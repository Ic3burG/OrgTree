# Contributor License Agreement

## OrgTree — OJD Technical Solutions

**Version 1.0 — Effective January 1, 2025**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **OrgTree**, a project maintained by **OJD Technical Solutions** (Omar Davis, Toronto, Ontario, Canada), referred to below as "We" or "Us."

This Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") defines the terms under which You contribute to the project. It protects both You and Us — You keep full ownership of your contributions, while We get the rights we need to maintain, distribute, and commercially license the project.

> **This CLA is administered automatically via [CLA Assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/) on GitHub.** You will be asked to sign it when you open your first pull request.

## 1. Definitions

- **"You"** (or **"Your"**) means the individual or legal entity making a Contribution.
- **"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship — including code, documentation, tests, configuration, or other material — that You intentionally submit to Us for inclusion in the project. This includes submissions via pull requests, issues, email, or any other method of communication with the project.
- **"Submit"** means any form of communication sent to the project (e.g., pull request, patch, issue comment), but does **not** include communications clearly marked "Not a Contribution."

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

You hereby grant to Us a **perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable** copyright license to:

- Reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute Your Contributions and any derivative works.
- **Sublicense** any or all of the above rights to third parties.

This sublicensing right is critical to the project's dual-licensing model: OrgTree is distributed publicly under the GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPL-3.0), and We also offer a separate commercial license to organizations that prefer not to comply with AGPL obligations.

## 3. Grant of Patent License

You hereby grant to Us a **perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable** patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer Your Contributions, where such license applies only to patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution alone or in combination with the project.

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or Us (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that a Contribution constitutes patent infringement, the patent license granted under this Section shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 4. You Retain Your Rights

This CLA does **not** transfer ownership of Your Contributions to Us. You retain full copyright and all other rights in Your Contributions. You are free to use, license, or distribute Your Contributions in any other project or context.

## 5. Originality and Authority

By submitting a Contribution, You certify that:

**(a)** The Contribution is Your original creation, and You have the legal right to grant the licenses in this CLA; **or**

**(b)** The Contribution is based on previous work that, to the best of Your knowledge, is covered under a compatible open-source license, and You have the right under that license to submit the work with the modifications You have made; **and**

**(c)** If Your employer or institution has rights to intellectual property that You create (including Your Contributions), You have received permission to make the Contribution, or Your employer has waived such rights, or Your employer has signed a separate entity CLA with Us.

You agree to notify Us promptly if any of the above statements become inaccurate.

## 6. "As-Is" Contributions

You provide Your Contributions on an **"AS IS" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind**, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions unless You choose to do so.

## 7. Governing Law

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without regard to conflict of law principles.

## 8. Entire Agreement

This CLA constitutes the entire agreement between You and Us regarding Contributions to the project. It supersedes all prior agreements or understandings, whether written or oral.
