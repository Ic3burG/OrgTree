# OrgTree Progress Report

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE FOR ALL FUTURE CONVERSATIONS**:
> This file MUST be updated every time changes are made to the codebase. Add session details, features implemented, bugs fixed, and security improvements to the "Recent Activity" section. Update the "Last Updated" date. **CRITICAL: Always commit changes AND push to GitHub** - local commits are not enough! This ensures project history is maintained and future sessions have full context.

## 🎯 Key Preferences

**CRITICAL**: These preferences must be followed in every conversation to maintain consistency and avoid repetition.

### Update Workflow
- **PROGRESS.md updates are MANDATORY**: Update this file after EACH command/task completion (not just at end of session)
- **Commit AND push ALL changes**: Never leave commits local-only; always push to GitHub
- **Update "Last Updated" date**: Change to current date when making any updates
- **Document in "Recent Activity"**: Add session details, features, bugs fixed, decisions made

### Development Preferences
- **Render CLI**: Installed and configured with API key authentication (not using CLI tokens)
  - Used for manual deployment triggers and production troubleshooting
  - Can trigger deploys: `render deploy`
  - Can view logs: `render logs -s orgtree`
  - Can access shell: `render shell orgtree`

    - Rewrote `AddMemberModal.jsx` with simple email input
    - Created `AcceptInvitation.jsx` page for accepting invites
    - Added invitation API methods to client
    - Updated ShareModal with invitation callbacks
  - **FILES CREATED**:
    - `server/src/services/email.service.js`
    - `server/src/services/invitation.service.js`
    - `server/src/routes/invitations.js`
    - `src/components/AcceptInvitation.jsx`
  - **FILES MODIFIED**:
    - `server/src/db.js` (migration for invitations table)
    - `server/src/index.js` (mount invitation routes)
    - `server/src/services/member.service.js`
    - `server/src/routes/members.js`
    - `src/api/client.js`
    - `src/App.jsx`
    - `src/components/admin/AddMemberModal.jsx`
    - `src/components/admin/ShareModal.jsx`
    - `server/.env.example`
  - **FILES DELETED**:
    - `src/components/admin/UserSearchSelect.jsx` (no longer needed)
  - **DEPENDENCIES**: Added `resend` package for email delivery
  - **ENVIRONMENT**: Requires `RESEND_API_KEY`, `APP_URL` for email functionality
  - **USER FLOW**:
    1. Admin enters email address in Add Member modal
    2. If user exists -> Added immediately
    3. If user doesn't exist -> "Send Invitation" button appears
    4. Invitation email sent with 7-day expiry
    5. Recipient accepts via `/invite/:token` page
  - **IMPACT**: Reliable team collaboration without broken search dependency
  - **FOLLOW-UP FEATURES**:
    - **Pending Invitations Display**: Added section in ShareModal showing all pending invitations
      - View email, role, invited by, and sent date
      - Cancel invitations with trash button
      - Auto-refreshes when new invitations are sent

      - Fixed invitation link generation (APP_URL configuration)
      - Configured Resend API integration (RESEND_API_KEY)
      - Fixed invitation acceptance route (moved to public routes)
  - **CRITICAL FIXES**:
    - ✅ Invitation links were showing placeholder URL `your-app.onrender.com`
      - Solution: Added `APP_URL` environment variable with actual Render URL
    - ✅ Invitation emails not sending with "email_not_configured" error
      - Solution: Added `RESEND_API_KEY` to Render environment variables
    - ✅ "Access token required" error when viewing invitations
      - Solution: Moved `GET /invitations/:token` to `GET /public/invitation/:token`
      - Public endpoint doesn't require authentication for invitation viewing
  - **DEPLOYMENT NOTES**:
    - Requires `RESEND_API_KEY` from https://resend.com (free tier: 100 emails/day)
    - Requires `APP_URL` set to actual Render URL (e.g., `https://orgtree-app.onrender.com`)
    - Emails from `onboarding@resend.dev` may go to spam (custom domain recommended for production)
  - **KNOWN LIMITATIONS**:
    - Sandbox mode: Resend only delivers to verified email addresses unless custom domain is configured
    - Invitation expiry: 7 days (hardcoded)
    - One pending invitation per email per organization (prevents duplicates)
  - **CRITICAL BUG FIX - Invitation Acceptance**:
    - ✅ **BUG FIXED**: Invitation acceptance now properly creates members and updates status
    - ✅ **ROOT CAUSE**: Missing `await` keyword in route handler caused response before DB operations completed
    - ✅ **SYMPTOMS**: Invitations showed as "pending" after acceptance, users had no access to organization
    - ✅ **SOLUTION**:
      - Added `await` to `acceptInvitation` call in route handler
      - Added validation to verify member insertion succeeds (checks `changes > 0`)
      - Added validation to verify invitation status update succeeds (checks `changes > 0`)
      - Throws errors if database operations fail
    - ✅ **FILES MODIFIED**:
      - `server/src/routes/invitations.js`: Added await keyword
      - `server/src/services/invitation.service.js`: Added database operation validation
    - 📝 **IMPACT**: Invitation acceptance now properly adds users as members and marks invitations as accepted

  - ✅ **SOLUTION**: Renamed route from `/users/search` to `/members/search`
  - ✅ **FILES MODIFIED**:
    - `server/src/routes/members.js`: Changed route path
    - `src/api/client.js`: Updated API endpoint URL
    - `src/components/admin/UserSearchSelect.jsx`: Cleaned up debug logs

    - Added `/change-password` route to App.jsx
    - Added `createUser` and `changePassword` API methods to client.js
  - **User Flow**:
    1. Superuser creates new user via Create User button
    2. System generates 12-char cryptographic temporary password
    3. Temporary password shown once with copy-to-clipboard functionality
    4. New user logs in with temporary password
    5. User immediately redirected to `/change-password` (cannot access app)
    6. After changing password, user logged out and must log in again with new password
    7. `must_change_password` flag cleared, user gains full app access
  - **Security Features**:
    - Temporary passwords are cryptographically random (12 alphanumeric characters)

    - Created `users.js` routes with 6 superuser-only endpoints (list, get, update, change role, reset password, delete)
    - Updated default role from 'admin' to 'user' for new signups
    - Added rate limiting for password reset endpoint
    - **PRODUCTION FIX**: Added `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` and `trustProxy: true` to rate limiters to fix rate limiting behind Render's proxy
  - **Frontend Changes**:
    - Added role helpers to AuthContext (`isSuperuser`, `isAdmin`, `canManageUsers`)
