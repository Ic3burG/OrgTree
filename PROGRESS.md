# OrgTree Progress Report

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE FOR ALL FUTURE CONVERSATIONS**:
> This file MUST be updated every time changes are made to the codebase. Add session details, features implemented, bugs fixed, and security improvements to the "Recent Activity" section. Update the "Last Updated" date. **CRITICAL: Always commit changes AND push to GitHub** - local commits are not enough! This ensures project history is maintained and future sessions have full context.

## 🌑 Key Preferences

**CRITICAL**: These preferences must be followed in every conversation to maintain consistency and avoid repetition.

### Update Workflow

- **PROGRESS.md updates are MANDATORY**: Update this file after EACH command/task completion (not just at end of session)
- **Commit AND push ALL changes**: Never leave commits local-only; always push to GitHub
- **Update "Last Updated" date**: February 7, 2026
- **Document in "Recent Activity"**: Add session details, features, bugs fixed, decisions made

**Session 58 (February 7, 2026 - OrgMap Deep-Link Zoom & Touch Scroll Fixes)**:

- 🐛 **Bug Fix: Deep-link zoom not working from People tab**: Clicking a person's name in the People tab navigated to the Org Map and opened the DetailPanel, but failed to zoom to or expand the person's department node.
  - **Root Cause**: Race condition — the deep-link `useEffect` in `OrgMap.tsx` checked `isLoading` and `nodes.length` but not `isMapReady`. When navigating from the People tab, `setCenter()` was called before React Flow's `onInit` fired, so the zoom was silently discarded while `setSelectedPerson()` (plain React state) still worked.
  - **Fix**: Added `isMapReady` gate to the deep-link effect's condition and dependency array. Also removed unnecessary 500ms `setTimeout` workaround for the `departmentId` path since the proper gate eliminates the timing issue.
- 🐛 **Bug Fix: Touch scrolling in department nodes**: On mobile/iPad, swiping on the expanded people list inside a department node panned the React Flow canvas instead of scrolling through names.
  - **Root Cause**: React Flow v11 captures all pointer/touch events for canvas panning, overriding the native scroll behavior of the `overflow-y-auto` container despite the `touch-pan-y` CSS hint.
  - **Fix**: Added React Flow's built-in interaction-blocking classes (`nopan nowheel nodrag`) to the scrollable people list in `DepartmentNode.tsx`. Added `overscroll-y-contain` to prevent scroll chaining at list boundaries.
- 📁 **FILES MODIFIED** (2 files):
  - `src/components/OrgMap.tsx` — Added `isMapReady` to deep-link effect guard, cleaned up setTimeout workarounds
  - `src/components/DepartmentNode.tsx` — Added `nopan nowheel nodrag overscroll-y-contain` classes to people list scroll container

**Session 57 (February 7, 2026 - Mobile Experience Overhaul)**:

- ✅ **Mobile Layout Overhaul (ADR-027)**: Comprehensive fix for broken mobile experience across public and authenticated views.
  - **Phase 1 - Critical Layout Fixes**:
    - Updated viewport meta tag with `viewport-fit=cover` and `interactive-widget=resizes-content` for proper notch/keyboard handling on iOS/Android
    - Added `safe-area-inset-bottom` and `pb-safe` utility classes to `src/index.css` (previously dead classes)
    - Rebuilt `Toolbar.tsx` from a 10-button vertical column (overflowing on phones) into a collapsible FAB on mobile with a 3x3 labeled grid panel; desktop layout unchanged
    - Fixed viewport height bugs: `h-screen` -> `h-full` in OrgMap (inside AdminLayout), `h-screen` -> `h-dvh` in PublicOrgMap and AdminLayout (standalone containers)
    - Hidden MiniMap on mobile (`hidden lg:block`) in both OrgMap and PublicOrgMap — saves ~120x80px of screen space
    - Compacted PublicOrgMap badge on mobile: hidden icon/subtitle, reduced padding
  - **Phase 2 - Modal & Form Keyboard Fixes**:
    - Changed `max-h-[90vh]` to `max-h-[85dvh]` across all 7 modal components (PersonForm, DepartmentForm, ImportModal, GedsUrlImporter, ShareModal, BulkEditModal, TransferOwnershipModal)
    - Added sticky submit button footers to PersonForm and DepartmentForm so action buttons stay visible while scrolling long forms
    - Repositioned Toast above MobileNav on mobile (`bottom-20`), full-width on narrow screens to prevent overflow on 320px devices
  - **Phase 3 - Polish**:
    - Added `pb-safe` to DetailPanel for notched phone bottom padding
- 📁 **FILES MODIFIED** (15 files):
  - `index.html`, `src/index.css`, `src/components/Toolbar.tsx`, `src/components/OrgMap.tsx`, `src/components/PublicOrgMap.tsx`, `src/components/admin/AdminLayout.tsx`, `src/components/admin/PersonForm.tsx`, `src/components/admin/DepartmentForm.tsx`, `src/components/admin/ImportModal.tsx`, `src/components/admin/GedsUrlImporter.tsx`, `src/components/admin/ShareModal.tsx`, `src/components/admin/BulkEditModal.tsx`, `src/components/admin/TransferOwnershipModal.tsx`, `src/components/ui/Toast.tsx`, `src/components/DetailPanel.tsx`

**Session 56 (February 5, 2026 - "Did you mean?" Search Suggestions)**:

- ✅ **Feature Implementation**: Added "Did you mean?" search suggestions (ADR-026) to improve UX on zero-result searches.
  - **Backend**:
    - Implemented `getSearchSuggestions` in `search.service.ts` using Trigram FTS to find similar names when no results are found.
    - Updated `search` function to populate the `suggestions` field in `SearchResponse`.
    - Verified logic with new unit tests in `search.service.test.ts`.
  - **Frontend**:
    - Updated `useSearch` hook to capture `didYouMeanSuggestions` from the API response and renamed the existing autocomplete `suggestions` to `autocompleteSuggestions` for clarity.
    - Updated `SearchOverlay.tsx` to display suggestions in the "No results found" state.
    - Added logic to automatically open the dropdown if suggestions are available.
    - Verified functionality with updated and new tests in `SearchOverlay.test.tsx`.
- 📁 **FILES MODIFIED**:
  - `server/src/services/search.service.ts`
  - `server/src/services/search.service.test.ts`
  - `src/hooks/useSearch.ts`
  - `src/components/SearchOverlay.tsx`
  - `src/components/SearchOverlay.test.tsx`
  - `PROGRESS.md` (This file)

**Session 55 (February 3, 2026 - Invitation Flow Fix)**:

- 🐛 **Bug Fix**: Resolved issue where "Send Invitation" option was not appearing when adding a new member by email (user not found).
  - **Root Cause**:
    1. `api.client.ts`: `addMemberByEmail` was returning `{ success: false }` instead of throwing an error, bypassing usage of `catch` block in `AddMemberModal`.
    2. `AddMemberModal.tsx`: The "Add Member" button was disabled because `email` state wasn't being updated when typing in the search box (only on selection).
  - **Fix**:
    - Updated `src/api/client.ts` to throw "User not found" error when backend returns `success: false`.
    - Updated `src/components/admin/AddMemberModal.tsx` to sync `email` state with search query, allowing submission of unknown emails.
  - **Verification**: Created `src/components/admin/AddMemberModal.test.tsx` to verify the fix and prevent regression.
- 📁 **FILES MODIFIED**:
  - `src/api/client.ts`
  - `src/components/admin/AddMemberModal.tsx`
  - `src/components/admin/AddMemberModal.test.tsx` (Created)
  - `PROGRESS.md` (This file)

**Session 55b (February 3, 2026 - Invitation "Invalid Date" Fix)**:

- 🐛 **Bug Fix**: Resolved "Sent Invalid Date" display issue when viewing pending invitations.
  - **Root Cause**: Backend `getOrgInvitations` was aliasing database fields to camelCase (`createdAt`, `expiresAt`) but frontend types expected snake_case (`created_at`, `expires_at`).
  - **Fix**:
    - Updated `server/src/services/invitation.service.ts` to return snake_case field names matching frontend types.
    - Added `created_at` field to `CreateInvitationResult` interface and both `createInvitation` and `resendInvitation` return values.
    - Updated `InvitationRecord` interface to include `created_at` field.
  - **Email Issue**: The "email not sent" issue is due to missing `RESEND_API_KEY` configuration. Email service gracefully degrades when not configured.
- 📁 **FILES MODIFIED**:
  - `server/src/services/invitation.service.ts`
  - `server/src/routes/auth.ts` (Formatting)
  - `PROGRESS.md` (This file)

**Session 55c (February 3, 2026 - Email Error Handling Improvement)**:

- 🐛 **Bug Fix**: Resolved "Email service is not configured. Please contact the administrator." error that was blocking invitation creation.
  - **Root Cause**: Frontend was treating email sending failure as a hard error, preventing successful invitation creation from being recognized.
  - **Fix**:
    - Updated `src/components/admin/AddMemberModal.tsx` to check `emailSent` field in invitation response.
    - Changed error handling to show success toast with informative note when invitation is created but email can't be sent.
    - Invitation creation now succeeds gracefully even when email service is not configured.
  - **User Experience**: Users now see "Invitation created successfully! Note: Email notification could not be sent, but the user can still accept via the invite link."
- 📁 **FILES MODIFIED**:
  - `src/components/admin/AddMemberModal.tsx`
  - `PROGRESS.md` (This file)

**Session 54 (February 3, 2026 - Session Revocation Fix)**:

- 🐛 **Bug Fix**: Resolved "No current session found" error when clicking "Revoke All Other Sessions".
  - **Root Cause**: Cookie path restrictions (`/api/auth`) likely prevented the refresh token cookie from being sent correctly in some environments, making it impossible to identify the current session to exclude from revocation.
  - **Fix**:
    - **Cookie Security**: Relaxed `SameSite` from `Strict` to `Lax` to allow cookies in cross-port development environments (e.g., frontend on 5173, backend on 3001).
    - **Cookie Path**: Widened `refreshToken` cookie path to `/` (root) for maximum compatibility.
    - **Cleanup**: Implemented migration logic to clear legacy cookies at `/api/auth` during login/refresh.
    - **Refactor**: Removed redundant `cookieParser` middleware from `auth.ts`.
  - **Testing**: Updated `auth.test.ts` to verify multiple cookie operations and correct paths.
- 📁 **FILES MODIFIED**:
  - `server/src/routes/auth.ts`
  - `server/src/routes/auth.test.ts`
  - `PROGRESS.md` (This file)

**Session 53 (February 3, 2026 - Active Sessions Bug Fix)**:

- 🐛 **Bug Fix**: Resolved "Active Settings" (Active Sessions) display issue where all information was "unknown".
  - **Root Cause**: Backend `getUserSessions` was returning camelCase fields (`deviceInfo`, `ipAddress`) while frontend expected snake_case (`device_info`, `ip_address`).
  - **Fix**: Updated `server/src/services/auth.service.ts` to alias SQL columns to snake_case.
  - **Enhancement**: Implemented `is_current` logic in `server/src/routes/auth.ts` by matching the refresh token cookie.
  - **Testing**: Updated `auth.service.test.ts` and `auth.test.ts` to verify snake_case properties and current session detection.
- 📁 **FILES MODIFIED**:
  - `server/src/services/auth.service.ts`
  - `server/src/routes/auth.ts`
  - `server/src/services/auth.service.test.ts`
  - `server/src/routes/auth.test.ts`
  - `PROGRESS.md` (This file)

**Session 47 (January 28, 2026 - Security Audit Phase 2 Execution)**:

### Development Preferences

- **Render CLI**: Installed and configured with API key authentication (not using CLI tokens)
  - Used for manual deployment triggers and production troubleshooting
  - Can trigger deploys: `render deploy`
  - Can view logs: `render logs -s orgtree`
  - Can access shell: `render shell orgtree`

### Code Quality (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Run ALL linters BEFORE every commit. No exceptions.

**Required checks before ANY commit**:

1. Backend: `cd server && npm run lint` - ESLint must pass with 0 errors
2. Backend: `cd server && npm run format:check` - Prettier must pass with 0 warnings
3. If Prettier fails: Run `cd server && npm run format` to auto-fix, then commit
4. Frontend: `npm run lint` - ESLint must pass with 0 errors
5. Frontend: `npm run format:check` - Prettier must pass with 0 warnings
6. If Prettier fails: Run `npm run format` to auto-fix, then commit

**Workflow**:

```bash

# ALWAYS run these before git commit:
cd server && npm run lint && npm run format:check
cd .. && npm run lint && npm run format:check

# If format:check fails, auto-fix:
cd server && npm run format  # or npm run format in root

```

**Why this matters**: The user should NEVER see lint/format errors after a push. Code quality checks are automated in pre-commit hooks, but they must be run manually during development to catch issues early.

    - **Staging Service**: Set up `orgtree-staging` on Render (free tier) pointing to `develop` branch
    - **Environment Isolation**: Staging uses separate JWT_SECRET, DATABASE_URL, and URLs
    - **Build Fix**: Updated `render-build.sh` to use `npm ci --include=dev` to ensure devDependencies (TypeScript, Vite) are installed during build
    - **Documentation**: Comprehensive update to `.github/CICD_SETUP.md` with branch strategy diagram, staging setup guide, and troubleshooting
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED**:
    - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Added `develop` branch to triggers

- **Previous Progress (January 19, 2026 - Session 58)**:
  - ✧ **FEATURE**: Star/Favorite People
    - **Implementation**: Added ability to "star" people to mark them as favorites. Starred people appear at the top of their department lists on the OrgMap. Starred people appear at the top of their department lists on the OrgMap.
    - **Database**: Added `is_starred` column (boolean) to `people` table.
    - **Frontend**: Added Star toggle in Person Form, Star icon in Person lists (Admin & OrgMap), and sorting logic.
    - **Backend**: Updated services to handle `is_starred` persistence and sorting.
    - **Testing**: Added backend tests for persistence and sorting logic. Verified frontend type safety.
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED**: 8+ files across stack (`server/src/db.ts`, `services/people.service.ts`, `types/index.ts`, `PersonForm.tsx`, `OrgMap.tsx`, `PersonRowCard.tsx`, etc.)
  - ✅ **COMMITS PUSHED**: Commit [hash] - "feat: implement star/favorite person feature"
- 📁 **TESTING**:
  - Backend tests passing ✅ (including new star logic)
  - Frontend type check passing ✅
  - ✧ **FEATURE**: Collapsible Admin Sidebar (Option B)
    - **Implementation**: Added a user-controlled toggle to the admin sidebar with `localStorage` persistence to remember user preference across sessions.
    - **Visual Design**: Switched from simple arrows to modern `PanelLeftClose` and `PanelLeft` icons, matching high-end agent manager interfaces.
    - **Responsive Layout**: Sidebar transitions smoothly between `w-64` (256px) and `w-20` (80px), with main content margins adjusting dynamically.
    - **Accessibility**: Implemented `sr-only` labels for screen readers and native browser tooltips (via `title` attribute) for collapsed navigation icons.
    - **Future-Proofing**: Updated `ROADMAP.md` with advanced sidebar features (resizable sidebar, multi-level collapse).

- **Previous Progress (January 16, 2026 - Session 57)**:
  - 🐛 **BUG FIX**: Department Hover Tooltip Links Not Working
    - **Issue**: When hovering over the people count in the Departments tab, a tooltip appeared showing people's names. These were intended to be clickable links to navigate to the Org Map, but the tooltip would disappear before users could click on them.
    - **Root Cause**: The tooltip was configured to appear on `onMouseEnter` and disappear on `onMouseLeave` of the trigger element. When users moved their mouse from the trigger to the tooltip to click a link, they would leave the trigger element, causing `onMouseLeave` to fire and hide the tooltip before the click could register.
    - **Fix**: Added `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` handlers to the tooltip div itself in `DepartmentItem.tsx`, keeping the tooltip visible when users move their mouse into it.
    - **Impact**: Users can now hover over any department's people count, move their mouse into the tooltip, click on any person's name, and be taken directly to the Org Map with that person's department expanded and in focus.
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED**: 1 file (`src/components/admin/DepartmentItem.tsx`)
  - ✅ **COMMITS PUSHED**: Commit 3328a32 - "Fix department hover tooltip links"

- **Previous Progress (January 15, 2026 - Session 56)**:
  - ✧ **FEATURE COMPLETE**: Custom Fields Redesign & Integration
    - **Integrated Management**: Moved Custom Field management directly into Person and Department edit dialogs.
    - **Simplified UI**: Auto-generated field keys from names (e.g., "Slack Handle" -> `slack_handle`), default searchability, and hidden technical complexity.
    - **Cleanup**: Removed redundant "Custom Fields" sidebar link and legacy management page.
    - **Refinement**: Added clear indicators for required fields and improved form layout.
  - 🐛 **BUG FIX**: Fixed Session Expiry Loop with 2FA
    - **Issue**: Infinite redirect loop when logging in with 2FA enabled.
    - **Fix**: Updated `server/src/routes/auth.ts` to correctly return `requiresTwoFactor` and `tempUserId` in the login response, properly triggering the 2FA flow.
  - 🐛 **BUG FIX**: Signup Page Dark Mode
    - **Issue**: Input fields were unreadable (white text on white background) on the signup page in dark mode.
    - **Fix**: Updated signup page styles to properly support dark mode themes.
  - 🐛 **BUG FIX**: Department Population
    - **Issue**: Department field failed to populate when editing a contact.

  - ✅ **COMMITS PUSHED**: Commits covering custom fields redesign and critical bug fixes.

- **Previous Progress (January 14, 2026 - Session 55)**:
  - 🐛 **BUG FIX**: Fixed Mobile Bottom Navigation Dark Mode
    - Added `dark:bg-slate-800`, `dark:border-slate-700`, and dark mode text color variants to `MobileNav.tsx`.
    - Navigation bar now correctly blends with the dark theme on mobile devices.
  - 🐛 **BUG FIX**: Resolved Search Type Mismatches
    - Updated `SearchOverlay.tsx` to use `department_id` instead of `departmentId` to match backend `snake_case` conventions.
    - Updated `src/types/index.ts` `SearchResult` and `SearchResponse` interfaces to reflect recent backend changes.
    - Fixed `useSearch.test.ts` by adding the required `query` property to the mock API response.
  - 🗑️ **CODE QUALITY**:
    - Verified all changes with `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint`.
    - All tests passing locally and verified clean build.
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED**: 5 files
  - ✅ **COMMITS PUSHED**: Committed and pushed fix for mobile nav and search types.
  - ✧ **FEATURE**: People List Sorting
    - Added sorting controls to People tab in Organization Dashboard.
    - Supported fields: Name, Department, Title, Date Added.
    - Features: Ascending/Descending toggle, case-insensitive sorting.

    - Available to all organization members (viewers, editors, admins, owners).
  - 🍳 **UI FIX**: Restored PersonForm layout
    - Moved Email field back under Department field (full width) as requested.
  - 🐛 **BUG FIX**: Fixed Public Link toggle in ShareModal
    - **Issue**: Toggle button didn't update visually despite successful API call.
    - **Root Cause 1**: Frontend expected `is_public` (snake_case) but backend returned `isPublic` (camelCase).
    - **Root Cause 2**: `ToastProvider` context value was unstable, causing `ShareModal` to re-fetch stale data on every toast.
    - **Fix**: Updated `ShareModal` to handle camelCase response.
    - **Fix**: Memoized `toast` context in `ToastProvider` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
    - **Test**: Added `ShareModal.test.tsx` to prevent regression.
- **Previous Progress (January 15, 2026 - Session 54)**:
  - 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Fixed Search Crash & "Zero Results" Error
  - ✅ **SEARCH STABILITY**:
    - **Crash Fix**: Resolved type mismatch in `SearchResult` causing app crash on search.
    - **Zero Results Fix**: Refactored backend FTS5 query to `UNION ALL` to fix "unable to use function MATCH in the requested context" error.
    - **Zoom Fix**: Added missing `departmentId` to search results so selecting a person correctly zooms to their department.
  - ✅ **DEPARTMENT UX**:
    - **Hover Popover**: Added "People" count hover popover in Department list to show members.
    - **Click-to-Zoom**: Clicking a person in the popover now auto-zooms to them on the map.
    - **Parent Editing**: Fixed `parent_id` vs `parentId` mismatch preventing department moves.
  - ✅ **DEEP LINKING**:
    - Added `?personId` URL parameter support to `/org/:orgId/map` for external navigation.

  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED**: 8+ files
  - ✅ **COMMITS PUSHED**: Multiple commits covering frontend and backend fixes
- **Previous Progress (January 15, 2026 - Session 53)**:
  - ✧ **FEATURE COMPLETE**: Custom Fields Framework & UI Integration
  - ✅ **CORE CAPABILITIES**:
    - **Custom Field Definitions**: Admin interface for creating attributes for People and Departments.
    - **Flexible Types**: Support for Text, Number, Date, Select, Multiselect, URL, Email, and Phone.
    - **Dynamic Reordering**: Native drag-and-drop interface for managing attribute priority.
    - **Search Integration**: SQLite FTS5 now indexes and searches within custom field values.
    - **Public Map Support**: Custom fields are visible in shared public organization charts.
  - ✅ **UI/UX REFINEMENT**:
    - Integrated `CustomFieldInput` for dynamic form rendering in `PersonForm` and `DepartmentForm`.
    - Added "Additional Information" section to `DetailPanel` (map view).

  - ✅ **SYSTEM INTEGRITY**:
    - Real-time Sync: Socket events for field definition changes (creation, updates, deletion, reordering).
    - Audit Logging: Standardized tracking of all custom field administrative actions.
    - Type Safety: Full TypeScript coverage for custom field interfaces and API methods.
- 📁 **VERIFICATION**:
  - Verified search results correctly highlight matches in custom fields.
  - Confirmed drag-and-drop reordering persists to backend.
  - Validated CSV import/export round-trip for custom data.
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED/CREATED**: 25+ files
  - ✅ **COMMITS PUSHED**: Multiple commits covering backend and frontend integration
- **Previous Progress (January 14, 2026 - Session 52)**:
  - ✧ **FEATURE COMPLETE**: Unified Account Management System
  - ✅ **NEW COMPONENTS**:
    - `AccountLayout.tsx` - Central hub for all account settings with tab navigation
    - `ProfileSettings.tsx` - Update user name and email
    - `SecurityCheck.tsx` - Proactive security banner prompting 2FA/Passkey setup
  - ✅ **NAVIGATION IMPROVEMENTS**:
    - Added "Settings" button to OrganizationSelector header (landing page access)
    - Added "Account Settings" link to AdminLayout sidebar
    - Unified routing at `/settings` with sub-routes for Security and Sessions
  - ✅ **BACKEND ENHANCEMENTS**:
    - `PUT /api/auth/profile` - New endpoint for profile updates
    - Applied `authenticateToken` middleware to all 2FA and Passkey routes
    - Fixed CORS configuration for local development (port 5174)
    - Centralized 2FA/Passkey API methods in frontend client
  - 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG FIX #1**: Passkey Registration Failure
    - **Root Cause**: Infinite recursion in `getErrorMessage()` helper in `passkey.ts`
    - Original code: `if (error instanceof Error) return getErrorMessage(error);` (calls itself!)
    - Fixed to: `if (error instanceof Error) return error.message;`
    - This bug caused ALL passkey operations to crash silently
  - 🐛 **BUG FIX #2**: Back Button History Navigation
    - Changed AccountLayout back button from `navigate(-1)` to `navigate('/')`
    - Now always returns to landing page instead of cycling through history
  - 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG FIX #3**: 2FA Login Failure
    - **Root Cause**: `SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_FOREIGNKEY` in audit logs
    - Login flow attempts to log event with `'system'` as org ID
    - Foreign key constraint requires valid organization reference
    - Resulted in "Invalid email or password" error for valid 2FA users
    - **Fix**:
      - Added migration to recreate `audit_logs` table with nullable `organization_id`
      - Updated `audit.service.ts` to pass `null` for system events
      - Updated TypeScript interfaces (`DatabaseUser`, `LoginResult`)
    - **Impact**: Users with 2FA enabled can now log in successfully
  - ✅ **Fixed Passkey Authentication Flow**:
    - **[FIX]** Refactored Passkey/WebAuthn authentication to use stateless cookie-based challenge storage.
    - **[FIX]** Resolved persistent "Authentication flow not started" errors during login.
  - 🗑️ **MAINTENANCE**: CI/Lint Fixes
    - **[FIX]** Addressed linting and TypeScript errors in `seed-via-api.ts` and `passkey.service.ts` to ensure clean CI.
    - Fixed type mismatch in `passkey.service.ts` (`allowCredentials`, `excludeCredentials`)
    - Resolved all linting issues for clean CI run
  - 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG FIX #4**: 2FA Silent Redirection Loop
    - **Root Cause**: Race condition between 2FA verification reload and AuthContext initialization.
    - `LoginPage.tsx` performed a full page reload (`window.location.href`) immediately after 2FA success.
    - `AuthContext.tsx` aggressively logged users out if `api.getMe()` failed during initialization (e.g., due to network race).
    - **Fix**:
      - **Frontend**: Switched `LoginPage.tsx` to use `useNavigate` for client-side transition (no reload).
      - **Context**: Updated `AuthContext.tsx` to only force logout on explicit 401/403 errors.
    - **Impact**: Seamless 2FA login experience without silent failures.
  - ✅ **BUILD FIX**: Resolved TypeScript error in `usePasskey.ts`
    - Fixed `PasskeyLoginResult` missing `created_at` property required by `User` type.
    - Updated hook to use shared `User` interface from `types/index.ts`.

  - ✅ **COMMITTED AND PUSHED**: Commit 68fe562
  - ⚠️ **CRITICAL CI/CD FIXES**: Resolved GitHub Actions failures in lint and backend test jobs
  - ✅ **ISSUE #1 IDENTIFIED**: Husky not found in CI
    - GitHub Actions failing with `sh: 1: husky: not found` during `cd server && npm ci`
    - Root cause: `prepare` script runs during `npm ci`, tries to execute `husky`
    - Husky is devDependency in root, not available when running `npm ci` in server directory
  - ✅ **FIX #1**: CI-aware prepare script
    - Modified `package.json` prepare script: `"prepare": "node -e \"process.exit(process.env.CI ? 0 : 1)\" || husky"`
    - Script exits successfully (code 0) if `CI` environment variable is set
    - Otherwise runs husky normally for local development
    - Committed (commit: 1b4e164)
    - **Result**: Husky error resolved ✅
  - ✅ **ISSUE #2 IDENTIFIED**: ESLint plugin resolution error in CI
    - GitHub Actions failing with `Cannot find package 'eslint-plugin-react' imported from eslint.config.js`
    - Root cause: NPM workspaces configuration incompatible with project structure
    - Project runs `npm ci` separately in frontend and backend (not a true monorepo)
    - Workspaces was causing dependency hoisting issues
  - ✅ **FIX #2**: Removed workspaces configuration
    - Attempted fix: Removed invalid `'.'` self-reference from workspaces array (commit: 5108de9) - Still failed ❌
    - Final fix: Removed `"workspaces"` field entirely from `package.json` (commit: 8dfd505) ✅
    - Rationale: Project uses multi-package structure, not monorepo
  - ✅ **ISSUE #3 IDENTIFIED**: Scripts broken after workspaces removal
    - `test:all` and `lint:all` scripts used `--workspaces` flag
    - Pre-push hook failed trying to run full test suite
  - ✅ **FIX #3**: Updated test and lint scripts

  - 📋 **NEXT STEPS**:
    - Monitor CI pipeline stability
    - Continue with planned feature development

- **Previous Progress (January 12, 2026 - Session 48)**:
  - ⚠️ **CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT FIX**: Resolved Render deployment failures by reverting Express 5
  - ✅ **ISSUE #1 IDENTIFIED**:
    - Render deployments showing `update_failed` status while GitHub Actions passed
    - Dependabot auto-merged Express 4.22.1 → 5.2.1 (major version upgrade)
    - Express 5 uses newer `path-to-regexp` library that rejects `'*'` syntax
    - Catch-all route `app.get('*', ...)` at `server/src/index.ts:230` crashed server at startup
    - **Runtime error**: `PathError [TypeError]: Missing parameter name at index 1: *`
  - ✅ **ATTEMPT #1**: Fixed path-to-regexp syntax incompatibility
    - `server/src/index.ts` - Changed `app.get('*', ...)` → `app.get('/*', ...)`
    - Committed and deployed (commit: ad91f68)
    - **Result**: Deployment still failed with `update_failed` status ❌
  - ✅ **ISSUE #2 IDENTIFIED**:
    - Build succeeded ✅ but server exited immediately with status 1 ❌
    - No error messages visible in logs (silent failure)
    - GitHub Actions only tests build/lint/test (doesn't start server), so it passed
    - Render deployed successfully but service crashed on startup (health check failed)
    - Express 5 has additional undocumented breaking changes beyond path-to-regexp
  - ✅ **SOLUTION APPLIED**: Reverted Express 5 → 4
    - `server/package.json` - Reverted Express 5.2.1 → 4.22.1
    - `server/src/index.ts` - Restored catch-all route `'/*'` → `'*'` (Express 4 syntax)
    - Committed and deployed (commit: 39148e8)
    - **Result**: Awaiting deployment confirmation ⌛️
- 📁 **VALIDATION**:
  - All 423 backend tests passing ✅
  - All 103 frontend tests passing ✅
  - All linters passing (ESLint + Prettier) ✅
  - GitHub Actions CI/CD both successful ✅
  - `npm install` successful (8 packages added, 37 removed with Express 4)
  - 🌑 **IMPACT**:
    - ✅ Restored working deployment configuration
    - ✅ Application should deploy successfully again
    - ⚠️ Express 5 upgrade deferred - requires dedicated migration effort
    - ✅ SPA routing continues to work correctly with Express 4
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED** (3 files):
    - `server/package.json` - Reverted Express version
    - `server/package-lock.json` - Dependency updates for Express 4
    - `server/src/index.ts` - Restored Express 4 catch-all syntax
  - 💭 **LESSONS LEARNED**:
    - Express 5 has breaking changes beyond the official migration guide
    - Silent production failures are harder to diagnose than build failures
    - GitHub Actions should test server startup, not just compilation
    - Dependabot should require manual approval for major version upgrades
    - PROGRESS.md line 334 was correct: "Skipped Express 5 upgrade (requires dedicated migration)"
  - 📋 **NEXT STEPS**:
    - Configure Dependabot to prevent auto-merge of major version upgrades
    - Add server startup tests to CI pipeline
    - Plan dedicated Express 5 migration with comprehensive testing

- **Previous Progress (January 11, 2026 - Session 47)**:
  - ⚠️ **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Restored OrgMap edge rendering - PERMANENT SOLUTION
  - ✅ **ISSUE IDENTIFIED** (Recurring bug from Sessions 25, 37):
    - Department hierarchy lines not displaying in organization chart
    - Root cause: Backend `org.service.ts` was aliasing database fields to camelCase
    - `parent_id as parentId` → Frontend checks `dept.parent_id` → undefined → no edges created
    - Silent failure: departments rendered correctly, but connection lines disappeared
    - This is a **data contract mismatch** between backend and frontend
  - ✅ **FIXES APPLIED** (6 files):
    - `server/src/services/org.service.ts` - Removed ALL camelCase aliases in SQL queries
      - Changed "parent_id as parentId" → "parent_id" (CRITICAL for edges)
      - Changed "organization_id as organizationId" → "organization_id"
      - Changed "sort_order as sortOrder" → "sort_order"
      - Applied to departments, people, and organizations queries
    - Updated TypeScript interfaces to enforce snake_case (Department, Person, OrganizationResult)
    - `server/src/services/org.service.test.ts` - Fixed test assertions to expect snake_case
    - `server/scripts/seed-large-dataset.ts` - Fixed lint errors (performance import, unused vars)
    - `server/scripts/seed-via-api.ts` - Fixed lint errors (any types, fetch global)
  - 🔒 **PREVENTION MEASURES** (This CANNOT happen again):
    - **New validation test suite**: `server/src/services/__field-naming-validation.test.ts`
      - 7 critical tests that verify snake_case field names
      - Explicitly checks `parent_id` exists (critical for OrgMap edges)
      - Tests fail if camelCase variants exist (parentId, organizationId, etc.)
      - **If these tests fail, edges will break - DO NOT IGNORE**
    - **Comprehensive documentation**: `FIELD_NAMING_CONVENTION.md` (250+ lines)
      - Explains why snake_case is mandatory for database fields
      - Provides correct/incorrect code examples
    - **Phase 6: Documentation & Polish** - IN PROGRESS
  - [x] Create ADR for ownership transfer system (ADR-018)
  - [x] Update user documentation (Ownership Transfer guide)
  - [x] Update API documentation (OpenAPI spec)
  - [ ] Add inline code comments
  - [ ] Final project cleanup

    - ⚠️ **Skipped Express 5** upgrade (4.22.1 → 5.2.1) - requires dedicated migration due to breaking changes
    - ✅ All 423 backend tests passing after updates
  - 💭 **LESSON LEARNED**:
    - This bug has occurred 3 times (Sessions 25, 37, 47) during refactoring
    - Backend MUST return snake_case to match frontend types
    - Database schema (snake_case) → Backend → Frontend (no transformation)
    - Automated validation is the only way to prevent architectural regressions

- **Previous Session (January 11, 2026 - Session 46)**:
  - 🎉 **PERFORMANCE TESTING COMPLETE**: Successfully benchmarked application with 1,000+ records
  - ✅ **API SEEDING STRATEGY**:
    - Developed `server/scripts/seed-via-api.ts` to populate data via HTTP calls
    - Handles authentication, CSRF tokens, and organization creation automatically
    - Successfully seeded **1,002 people** across **23 departments**
  - ✅ **BENCHMARK RESULTS**:
    - Created `e2e/performance.spec.ts` for automated load time measurement
    - **Total Load Time**: **467ms** (from navigation to full render)
    - **Shell Load**: 96ms
    - **Data Render**: 371ms
    - Verified on Chromium with 1,002 visible records
  - ✅ **ENVIRONMENT OPTIMIZATIONS**:
    - Relaxed backend rate limits in development mode (`authLimiter`) to allow seeding
    - Fixed `package.json` dev script compatibility issue with `tsx` flags
    - Points seed script directly to backend port 3001 for automated reliability
- 📁 **FILES MODIFIED/CREATED**:
  - `server/scripts/seed-via-api.ts` (New) - API-based data generator
  - `e2e/performance.spec.ts` (Refined) - Playwright benchmark script
  - `server/src/routes/auth.ts` - Relaxed rate limits for dev
  - `server/package.json` - Fixed `npm run dev` script
  - 🌑 **IMPACT**:
    - Confirmed application scalability for standard-sized organizations (~1000 records)
    - Established repeatable benchmarking infrastructure for future optimizations
    - Identified "virtualization" as the next performance milestone for 5k+ records

- **Previous Session (January 11, 2026 - Session 45)**:
  - 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Fixed bulk department delete showing false errors for cascade-deleted children
  - ✅ **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**:
    - When bulk deleting all departments, users saw errors like "Department not found in this organization"
    - Root cause: `softDeleteDepartment()` cascades and deletes all child departments when a parent is deleted
    - When the loop later processed those child departments, they were already soft-deleted
    - The query filtered `deleted_at IS NULL`, so they weren't found, triggering false errors
  - ✅ **FIX APPLIED** (1 backend file):
    - `server/src/services/bulk.service.ts` - Added check for already-deleted departments
    - First checks if department exists in organization (regardless of deleted_at status)
    - If exists but already soft-deleted → skip silently (was cascade-deleted by parent)
    - If doesn't exist at all → mark as failed with error
    - Only process departments that exist and aren't already deleted
  - ✅ **TESTING**:
    - All 321 backend tests passing ✅
    - Bulk service tests verify cascading deletion still works correctly
  - 🌑 **IMPACT**:
    - Users can now bulk delete all departments without seeing false errors
    - Cascade deletion still works as intended (deletes children with parents)
    - Error messages only shown for truly missing departments
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED**: `server/src/services/bulk.service.ts` - Added cascade-aware deletion check (18 lines added)
  - **TEST COVERAGE EXPANSION (PHASE 2 & 3)**:
  - **Target**: `src/utils` and `src/hooks` directories
  - **`src/utils` Coverage**:
    - Statements: 49.68% → **93.03%**
    - Functions: 36.36% → **89.09%**
    - Added tests for `layoutEngine.ts`, `csvExport.ts`, `csvImport.ts`, `exportUtils.ts` (mocking jsPDF/html-to-image)
  - **`src/hooks` Coverage**:
    - Statements: 13.11% → **65.57%**
    - Functions: 23.8% → **71.42%**
    - Added tests for `useSearch.ts` (debouncing), `useRealtimeUpdates.ts` (socket mocking), `usePasskey.ts` (WebAuthn mocking)
  - ️ **BUILD PROCESS HARDENING**:
  - **Linting Enforcement**: `npm run build` now runs `npm run lint` and `npm run format:check` _before_ compilation
  - **Verification**: Confirmed build failures on lint/format errors to prevent technical debt accumulation
- 📁 **FILES MODIFIED/CREATED**:
  - `package.json` - Updated build script
  - `src/utils/*.test.ts` - 4 new test files
  - `src/hooks/*.test.ts` - 3 new test files

- **Previous Session (January 11, 2026 - Session 44)**:
  - 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Fixed XML import not extracting full department hierarchy
  - ✅ **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**:
    - GEDS XML imports were only creating 1-2 levels of departments instead of full 6+ level hierarchies
    - Frontend parser looked for `<n>` tags but GEDS XML files use `<name>` tags
    - This caused parser to fail extracting department hierarchy from `<orgStructure>` section
    - Parser fell back to simple department/organization fields, losing all sub-departments
  - ✅ **FIX APPLIED** (1 frontend file):
    - `src/utils/xmlImport.ts` - Changed `getElementsByTagName('n')` to `getElementsByTagName('name')`
    - Now correctly extracts all department levels from orgStructure
  - 📣 **ROOT CAUSE**:
    - Original Node.js script used `xml2js` library which converts element names to properties
    - Browser's DOMParser keeps actual tag names (doesn't convert `<name>` to property)
    - Comment in original script said "xml2js parses `<n>` as 'name' property" but this was misleading
    - XML actually has `<name>` tags, not `<name>` tags
  - ✅ **TESTING**:
    - Created comprehensive test suite (`src/utils/xmlImport.test.ts`) with 3 tests
    - Tests verify full hierarchy extraction, fallback behavior, and duplicate detection
    - All 62 frontend tests passing ✅ (59 existing + 3 new)
    - All 321 backend tests passing ✅
- 📁 **GITHUB METADATA UPDATE**:
  - Added repository description: "Full-stack organizational directory and visualization platform..."
  - Added 12 topics: react, nodejs, express, sqlite, typescript, organizational-chart, etc.
  - Added homepage URL: [https://orgtree.onrender.com](https://orgtree.onrender.com)
  - 🌑 **IMPACT**:
    - GEDS XML imports now create full department hierarchies (6+ levels)
    - Sub-departments correctly imported and organized
    - Maintains all organizational structure from source XML files
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED/CREATED**:
    - `src/utils/xmlImport.ts` - 1 line changed (critical fix)
    - `src/utils/xmlImport.test.ts` - New comprehensive test file (145 lines)

- **Previous Session (January 11, 2026 - Session 43)**:
  - 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Fixed case-sensitive duplicate detection allowing duplicate records
  - ✅ **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**:
    - XML/CSV imports could create duplicate people with different email casing (e.g., `"john@example.com"` vs `"John@Example.com"`)
    - Regular people creation API had NO duplicate checking at all
    - Department and person name comparisons were also case-sensitive
    - SQLite's = operator is case-sensitive by default
  - ✅ **FIXES APPLIED** (2 files):
    - `server/src/routes/import.ts` - Updated all duplicate checks to use `LOWER(TRIM())` for case-insensitive, whitespace-tolerant comparisons
    - `server/src/services/people.service.ts` - Added duplicate detection to `createPerson()` and `updatePerson()` functions (was completely missing)
- 📁 **DUPLICATE DETECTION RULES**:
  - For people with emails: Check email uniqueness within entire organization (case-insensitive)
  - For people without emails: Check name uniqueness within department (case-insensitive)
  - For departments: Check name uniqueness within same parent (case-insensitive)
  - ✅ **TESTING**:
    - All 321 backend tests passing ✅
    - All 59 frontend tests passing ✅
    - Build verification successful
    - Pre-push checks passed
  - 🌑 **IMPACT**:
    - Users can no longer create duplicates by varying letter case or whitespace
    - Existing duplicate records can be manually cleaned up
    - Applies to both XML import and regular API endpoints
    - Improves data quality and integrity
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED**: `server/src/routes/import.ts` - 3 SQL queries updated
    - `server/src/services/people.service.ts` - Added validation to create/update functions

- **Previous Session (January 10, 2026 - Session 42)**:
  - 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Fixed soft-deleted records appearing in UI but unable to be deleted
  - ✅ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**:
    - Frontend queries (org.service.ts) were loading ALL records including soft-deleted ones
    - Backend bulk delete service properly filtered by `deleted_at IS NULL`
    - Mismatch caused soft-deleted people/departments to appear in UI but fail validation on delete
  - ✅ **FIXES APPLIED** (4 backend service files):
    - `org.service.ts` - Added `deleted_at IS NULL` filters to departments and people queries
    - `people.service.ts` - Added filter to max sort order query for new person creation
    - `search.service.ts` - Added filters to all FTS5 search queries (departments, people, autocomplete)
    - `org.service.test.ts` - Updated test database schema to include `deleted_at` columns
- 📁 **TESTING**:
  - All 321 backend tests passing ✅
  - Test schema aligned with production schema
  - Verified no regressions in existing functionality
  - 🌑 **IMPACT**:
    - Soft-deleted records no longer visible in UI
    - Bulk operations now work correctly
    - Search results exclude deleted records
    - Database integrity maintained with soft-delete pattern
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED** (4 backend service files):
    - `server/src/services/org.service.ts` - 2 queries updated
    - `server/src/services/people.service.ts` - 1 query updated
    - `server/src/services/search.service.ts` - 6 queries updated (search + autocomplete)
    - `server/src/services/org.service.test.ts` - Test schema fixed

- **Previous Session (January 10, 2026 - Session 41)**:

    - Frontend: Custom `usePasskey` hook, SecuritySettingsPage component
    - Login: "Sign in with Passkey" button with fallback to password
    - Multi-device support with credential management
  - ✅ **2FA (TOTP)**:

  - **Frontend** (10 files): `App.tsx`, `LoginPage.tsx`, `SecuritySettingsPage.tsx` (new), `TwoFactorVerification.tsx` (new), `PasskeyPrompt.tsx` (new), `package.json`
- 🎯 **COVERAGE**:
  - TypeScript: 0 errors in production code ✅
  - All authentication flows tested and working
  - Dark mode support throughout
- 🎉 **PRODUCTION READY**: Complete passwordless authentication with 2FA backup

- **Previous Session (January 10, 2026 - Session 39)**:
  - 🎉 **PHASE 1 COMPLETE**: Backend Route Testing - 13 new test files created
- 📁 **TEST COVERAGE EXPANSION**: Added 157 new route tests
  - Backend tests: 216 → 373 (+157 tests, +73%)
  - Total test files: 21 passing
  - Routes with tests: 1 → 14 routes (93% of testable routes)
- ✅ **NEW TEST FILES** (13 files created):
  - `departments.test.ts` (15 tests, 95% coverage)
    - `people.test.ts` (17 tests, 96% coverage)
    - `organizations.test.ts` (20 tests, 90% coverage)
    - `search.test.ts` (16 tests, 95% coverage)
    - `members.test.ts` (16 tests, 92% coverage)

  - 🌑 **COVERAGE IMPROVEMENTS**:
    - All major CRUD operations tested
    - Authentication and authorization thoroughly validated
    - Input validation and error handling tested
    - Real-time event emissions verified
    - Bulk operations and data imports covered
  - 👇 **TEST PATTERNS ESTABLISHED**:
    - JWT authentication testing
    - Permission-based access control
    - Input validation and sanitization
    - Service error handling
    - Socket event verification
  - 🎉 **READY FOR PHASE 2**: Backend service edge cases and low-coverage areas

- **Previous Session (January 10, 2026 - Session 37)**:
  - ⚠️ **CRITICAL FIX**: Resolved infinite loop causing Organization Map to not load
  - ️ **Root Cause**: Circular dependency in useCallback hooks
  - `loadData` depended on `handleToggleExpand`
  - `handleToggleExpand` depended on `edges`
  - `loadData` updated `edges` via `setEdges()`
  - This created an infinite re-render cycle
  - ✅ **Solution Implemented**:
    - Removed `handleToggleExpand` and `handleSelectPerson` from `loadData` dependencies
    - Removed callback injection from all layout functions (`handleToggleExpand`, `handleExpandAll`, `handleCollapseAll`, `handleToggleLayout`)
    - Callbacks now exclusively added via `nodesWithHighlight` useMemo (existing pattern)
    - Memoized real-time update callbacks to prevent unnecessary re-subscriptions
  - ️ **XML Import Name Format Fix**: Corrected name order in GEDS XML imports
  - **Issue**: Names were imported as "[Last Name], [First Name]" instead of "[First Name] [Last Name]"
  - **Root Cause**: Code was using the `fullName` field directly from XML (which is in "Last, First" format)
  - **Solution**: Always construct name from firstName + lastName fields in correct order
  - **Impact**: All imported names now display correctly as "First Last"
  - 🔒 **Duplicate Department Prevention**: Backend now prevents duplicate departments
    - **Issue**: Importing same data twice created duplicate departments
    - **Root Cause**: Backend only checked for duplicate people, not departments
    - **Solution**: Added department duplicate check by name + parent_id combination
    - **Behavior**: If department exists, reuses existing ID instead of creating duplicate
    - **Metrics**: Tracks `departmentsCreated` vs `departmentsReused` separately
    - **Impact**: Safe to re-import data without creating duplicates
  - ️ **Bulk Operations UI Refresh Bug**: Fixed bulk operations not refreshing UI
  - **Issue**: Bulk delete/move/edit showed success dialog but UI didn't refresh - counts stayed same
  - **Root Cause**: Frontend using wrong API response field names
    - Code was checking `result.success` (boolean) and `result.failed` instead of `result.deletedCount`, `result.updatedCount`, etc. (numbers)
    - Condition `if (result.success > 0)` evaluated to `if (true > 0)` = false
    - This prevented `loadData()` from being called, so UI never refreshed
  - **Solution**: Updated all bulk operation handlers to use correct field names
    - PersonManager: `handleBulkDelete`, `handleBulkMove`, `handleBulkEdit`
    - DepartmentManager: `handleBulkDelete`, `handleBulkEdit`
  - **Impact**: All bulk operations now correctly refresh the UI after completion
  - 📝 **Files Modified**:
    - `src/components/OrgMap.tsx` - Refactored callback dependency chain
    - `src/utils/xmlImport.ts` - Fixed name construction order
    - `server/src/routes/import.ts` - Added duplicate department detection

  **January 8, 2026 - CI Pipeline Unblocked (Session 25 Part 3)** ⚠️ ️:
  - 🐛 **CRITICAL CI ISSUE**: GitHub Actions pipeline failing on formatting checks
  - 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**:
    - CI format:check step was failing on search.service.test.ts
    - Prettier found formatting inconsistencies in the test file
    - This was blocking all deployments to production
  - ✅ **FIX APPLIED**:
    - Ran `prettier --write` on search.service.test.ts
    - Fixed 62 lines of formatting inconsistencies
    - Verified formatting checks now pass

- 📁 **TESTING**:
  - All 97 backend tests passing
  - All 32 frontend tests passing
  - Production build verified successful
  - Prettier format:check now passes
  - 🎉 **DEPLOYMENT**:

  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED** (1 file):
    - `server/src/services/search.service.test.ts` (formatting fixed)

  **January 8, 2026 - Critical Bug Fix #2: Org Chart Lines Restored (Session 25 Part 2)** ⚠️🔱:
  - 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG IDENTIFIED**: Department hierarchy lines not showing in Organization Map
  - 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**:
    - First fix (1732bec) corrected department.service.ts and people.service.ts
    - However, org.service.ts (used by OrgMap component) was missed
    - Frontend transformToFlowData() checks `dept.parent_id` to create edges
    - Backend org.service.ts still returned `dept.parentId` (camelCase)
    - When parent_id was undefined, no edges were created
    - Result: Departments rendered but no connecting lines displayed
  - ✅ **FIXES APPLIED**:
    - Fixed org.service.ts getOrganizationById() department query (3 fields: parent_id, organization_id, sort_order)
    - Fixed org.service.ts getOrganizationById() people query (3 fields: department_id, sort_order, created_at)
    - Fixed org.service.ts all organization queries (3 fields: created_by_id, created_at, updated_at)
    - Updated org.service.test.ts assertions (createdById → created_by_id)

- 📁 **TESTING**:
  - All 97 backend tests passing
  - All 32 frontend tests passing

    - `server/src/services/org.service.test.ts` (fixed 1 assertion)
  - 🌑 **PREVENTION**: Complete field naming consistency now achieved across ALL backend services

  **January 8, 2026 - Critical Bug Fix #1: Departments Now Visible (Session 25 Part 1)** ⚠️ ️:
  - 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG IDENTIFIED**: Departments not visible in Departments tab
  - 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**:
    - TypeScript migration (Session 19) introduced field naming mismatch
    - Backend services returned camelCase fields (organizationId, parentId, sortOrder, etc.)
    - Frontend types expected snake_case fields (organization_id, parent_id, sort_order, etc.)
    - This caused silent data parsing failures - data was received but unrecognized
    - React rendered empty lists instead of crashing, hiding the bug
  - ✅ **FIXES APPLIED**:
    - Reverted `department.service.ts` to return snake_case from SQL queries
    - Reverted `people.service.ts` to return snake_case from SQL queries
    - Fixed `people.ts` route type assertion (departmentId → department_id)
    - Updated `department.service.test.ts` field name assertions
    - Updated `people.service.test.ts` field name assertions

- 📁 **TESTING**: - All 97 backend tests passing (including updated test assertions) - All 32 frontend tests passing - Production build verified successful
  - 🎉 **DEPLOYMENT**:
    - Pushed commit `1732bec` to main branch
    - GitHub Actions CI/CD triggered
    - Deployed to production at <[https://orgtree-app.onrender.com](https://orgtree-app.onrender.com)>
  - 🌑 **IMPACT**:
    - Departments now display correctly in UI
    - Department creation/update/delete operations restored
    - People associations with departments working
    - Tree view, search, and bulk operations functioning
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED** (5 files):
    - `server/src/services/department.service.ts`
    - `server/src/services/people.service.ts`
    - `server/src/routes/people.ts`
    - `server/src/services/department.service.test.ts`
    - `server/src/services/people.service.test.ts`
  - 🌑 **LESSON LEARNED**: When migrating to TypeScript, maintain consistency between database schema (snake_case), backend responses, and frontend types to prevent silent parsing failures

  **January 7, 2026 - Code Cleanup, Testing & Compliance (Session 22)** 🗑️ ⚖️:

  **January 7, 2026 - CI Pipeline Fixes (Session 20)** ✅:
  - ✅ **CI PIPELINE NOW PASSING**: All GitHub Actions checks green
  - ✅ **RENDER DEPLOYMENT FIX**:
    - **Issue**: `tsx: not found` error in production
    - **Root Cause**: `tsx` was in devDependencies, but Render runs `npm install --production`
    - **Fix**: Moved `tsx` to dependencies in server/package.json
    - **Result**: Production deployment successful, server running
  - ✅ **BACKEND ESLINT FIXES** (74 errors → 0):
    - **@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any**: Replaced all `any` types with proper TypeScript types
    - **Routes**: Changed `error: any` to `error: unknown` with type guards
    - **Services**: Created proper interfaces (DeletedPerson, MovedPerson, BulkEditFields, etc.)
    - **Socket Events**: Changed `Record<string, any>` to `Record<string, unknown>`
    - **Test Files**: Converted `require()` to `await import()` for ES modules
    - **Global Types**: Added eslint-disable for empty interface (required for Express augmentation)
  - ✅ **PRETTIER FORMATTING** (30 files formatted):
    - Applied consistent code style across all backend TypeScript files
    - Fixed inconsistent indentation, line breaks, and quote styles
    - Ensured CI format check passes
  - ✅ **KEY INSIGHT: Pre-commit vs CI**:
    - Pre-commit hooks use `lint-staged` (only checks staged files)
    - CI pipeline lints the entire codebase
    - Files modified before staging weren't checked by pre-commit but caught by CI
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED**:
    - server/package.json (tsx moved to dependencies)
    - 30 backend TypeScript files (Prettier formatting)
    - 15+ route files (any → unknown type fixes)
    - 10+ service files (proper interfaces)
    - 3 test files (require → import)
  - 🌑 **FINAL CI STATUS**: All checks passing ✅
    - ESLint: 0 errors
    - Prettier: All files formatted
    - Tests: 76 passing (44 backend + 32 frontend)
    - Build: Successful
    - Type-check: 0 errors
