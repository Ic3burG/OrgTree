# OrgTree Progress Report

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE FOR ALL FUTURE CONVERSATIONS**:
> This file MUST be updated every time changes are made to the codebase. Add session details, features implemented, bugs fixed, and security improvements to the "Recent Activity" section. Update the "Last Updated" date. **CRITICAL: Always commit changes AND push to GitHub** - local commits are not enough! This ensures project history is maintained and future sessions have full context.

## 🎯 Key Preferences

**CRITICAL**: These preferences must be followed in every conversation to maintain consistency and avoid repetition.

### Update Workflow

- **PROGRESS.md updates are MANDATORY**: Update this file after EACH command/task completion (not just at end of session)
- **Commit AND push ALL changes**: Never leave commits local-only; always push to GitHub
- **Update "Last Updated" date**: Change to current date when making any updates
- **Document in "Recent Activity"**: Add session details, features, bugs fixed, decisions made

### Development Preferences

- **Render CLI**: Installed and configured with API key authentication (not using CLI tokens)
  - Used for manual deployment triggers and production troubleshooting
  - Can trigger deploys: `render deploy`
  - Can view logs: `render logs -s orgtree`
  - Can access shell: `render shell orgtree`

### Code Quality (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Run ALL linters BEFORE every commit. No exceptions.

**Required checks before ANY commit**:

1. Backend: `cd server && npm run lint` - ESLint must pass with 0 errors
2. Backend: `cd server && npm run format:check` - Prettier must pass with 0 warnings
3. If Prettier fails: Run `cd server && npm run format` to auto-fix, then commit
4. Frontend: `npm run lint` - ESLint must pass with 0 errors
5. Frontend: `npm run format:check` - Prettier must pass with 0 warnings
6. If Prettier fails: Run `npm run format` to auto-fix, then commit

**Workflow**:

```bash
# ALWAYS run these before git commit:
cd server && npm run lint && npm run format:check
cd .. && npm run lint && npm run format:check

# If format:check fails, auto-fix:
cd server && npm run format  # or npm run format in root
```

**Why this matters**: The user should NEVER see lint/format errors after a push. Code quality checks are automated in pre-commit hooks, but they must be run manually during development to catch issues early.

### Recent Activity

- **Today's Progress (January 19, 2026 - Session 58)**:
  - ✨ **FEATURE**: Star/Favorite People
    - **Implementation**: Added ability to "star" people to mark them as favorites. Starred people appear at the top of their department lists on the OrgMap.
    - **Database**: Added `is_starred` column (boolean) to `people` table.
    - **Frontend**: Added Star toggle in Person Form, Star icon in Person lists (Admin & OrgMap), and sorting logic.
    - **Backend**: Updated services to handle `is_starred` persistence and sorting.
    - **Testing**: Added backend tests for persistence and sorting logic. Verified frontend type safety.
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED**: 8+ files across stack (`server/src/db.ts`, `services/people.service.ts`, `types/index.ts`, `PersonForm.tsx`, `OrgMap.tsx`, `PersonRowCard.tsx`, etc.)
  - ✅ **COMMITS PUSHED**: Commit [hash] - "feat: implement star/favorite person feature"
  - 📊 **TESTING**:
    - Backend tests passing ✅ (including new star logic)
    - Frontend type check passing ✅
  - ✨ **FEATURE**: Collapsible Admin Sidebar (Option B)
    - **Implementation**: Added a user-controlled toggle to the admin sidebar with `localStorage` persistence to remember user preference across sessions.
    - **Visual Design**: Switched from simple arrows to modern `PanelLeftClose` and `PanelLeft` icons, matching high-end agent manager interfaces.
    - **Responsive Layout**: Sidebar transitions smoothly between `w-64` (256px) and `w-20` (80px), with main content margins adjusting dynamically.
    - **Accessibility**: Implemented `sr-only` labels for screen readers and native browser tooltips (via `title` attribute) for collapsed navigation icons.
    - **Future-Proofing**: Updated `ROADMAP.md` with advanced sidebar features (resizable sidebar, multi-level collapse).
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED**: 2 files (`src/components/admin/AdminLayout.tsx`, `ROADMAP.md`)
  - ✅ **COMMITS PUSHED**: Commit 821e627 - "feat: improve sidebar collapse button with panel icons"
  - 📊 **TESTING**:
    - All 110 frontend tests passing ✅
    - All 403 backend tests passing ✅
    - Production build successful ✅

- **Previous Progress (January 16, 2026 - Session 57)**:
  - 🐛 **BUG FIX**: Department Hover Tooltip Links Not Working
    - **Issue**: When hovering over the people count in the Departments tab, a tooltip appeared showing people's names. These were intended to be clickable links to navigate to the Org Map, but the tooltip would disappear before users could click on them.
    - **Root Cause**: The tooltip was configured to appear on `onMouseEnter` and disappear on `onMouseLeave` of the trigger element. When users moved their mouse from the trigger to the tooltip to click a link, they would leave the trigger element, causing `onMouseLeave` to fire and hide the tooltip before the click could register.
    - **Fix**: Added `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` handlers to the tooltip div itself in `DepartmentItem.tsx`, keeping the tooltip visible when users move their mouse into it.
    - **Impact**: Users can now hover over any department's people count, move their mouse into the tooltip, click on any person's name, and be taken directly to the Org Map with that person's department expanded and in focus.
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED**: 1 file (`src/components/admin/DepartmentItem.tsx`)
  - ✅ **COMMITS PUSHED**: Commit 3328a32 - "Fix department hover tooltip links"
  - 📊 **TESTING**:
    - All 110 frontend tests passing ✅
    - All 168 backend tests passing ✅
    - Production build successful ✅
    - All linters passing (ESLint + Prettier) ✅

  - ✨ **FEATURE COMPLETE**: Custom Fields Redesign & Integration
    - **Integrated Management**: Moved Custom Field management directly into Person and Department edit dialogs.
    - **Simplified UI**: Auto-generated field keys from names (e.g., "Slack Handle" -> `slack_handle`), default searchability, and hidden technical complexity.
    - **Cleanup**: Removed redundant "Custom Fields" sidebar link and legacy management page.
    - **Refinement**: Added clear indicators for required fields and improved form layout.
  - 🐛 **BUG FIX**: Fixed Session Expiry Loop with 2FA
    - **Issue**: Infinite redirect loop when logging in with 2FA enabled.
    - **Fix**: Updated `server/src/routes/auth.ts` to correctly return `requiresTwoFactor` and `tempUserId` in the login response, properly triggering the 2FA flow.
  - 🐛 **BUG FIX**: Signup Page Dark Mode
    - **Issue**: Input fields were unreadable (white text on white background) on the signup page in dark mode.
    - **Fix**: Updated signup page styles to properly support dark mode themes.
  - 🐛 **BUG FIX**: Department Population
    - **Issue**: Department field failed to populate when editing a contact.

- **Previous Progress (January 14, 2026 - Session 55)**:
  - 🐛 **BUG FIX**: Fixed Mobile Bottom Navigation Dark Mode
    - Added `dark:bg-slate-800`, `dark:border-slate-700`, and dark mode text color variants to `MobileNav.tsx`.
    - Navigation bar now correctly blends with the dark theme on mobile devices.
  - 🐛 **BUG FIX**: Resolved Search Type Mismatches
    - Updated `SearchOverlay.tsx` to use `department_id` instead of `departmentId` to match backend `snake_case` conventions.
    - Updated `src/types/index.ts` `SearchResult` and `SearchResponse` interfaces to reflect recent backend changes.
    - Fixed `useSearch.test.ts` by adding the required `query` property to the mock API response.
  - 🧹 **CODE QUALITY**:
    - Verified all changes with `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint`.
    - All tests passing locally and verified clean build.
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED**: 5 files
  - ✅ **COMMITS PUSHED**: Committed and pushed fix for mobile nav and search types.
  - ✨ **FEATURE**: People List Sorting
    - Added sorting controls to People tab in Organization Dashboard.
    - Supported fields: Name, Department, Title, Date Added.
    - Features: Ascending/Descending toggle, case-insensitive sorting.
    - Handles sorting of mixed data sources (API search results + local list).
    - Available to all organization members (viewers, editors, admins, owners).
  - 💄 **UI FIX**: Restored PersonForm layout
    - Moved Email field back under Department field (full width) as requested.
  - 🐛 **BUG FIX**: Fixed Public Link toggle in ShareModal
    - **Issue**: Toggle button didn't update visually despite successful API call.
    - **Root Cause 1**: Frontend expected `is_public` (snake_case) but backend returned `isPublic` (camelCase).
    - **Root Cause 2**: `ToastProvider` context value was unstable, causing `ShareModal` to re-fetch stale data on every toast.
    - **Fix**: Updated `ShareModal` to handle camelCase response.
    - **Fix**: Memoized `toast` context in `ToastProvider` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
    - **Test**: Added `ShareModal.test.tsx` to prevent regression.
- **Previous Progress (January 15, 2026 - Session 54)**:
  - 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Fixed Search Crash & "Zero Results" Error
  - ✅ **SEARCH STABILITY**:
    - **Crash Fix**: Resolved type mismatch in `SearchResult` causing app crash on search.
    - **Zero Results Fix**: Refactored backend FTS5 query to `UNION ALL` to fix "unable to use function MATCH in the requested context" error.
    - **Zoom Fix**: Added missing `departmentId` to search results so selecting a person correctly zooms to their department.
  - ✅ **DEPARTMENT UX**:
    - **Hover Popover**: Added "People" count hover popover in Department list to show members.
    - **Click-to-Zoom**: Clicking a person in the popover now auto-zooms to them on the map.
    - **Parent Editing**: Fixed `parent_id` vs `parentId` mismatch preventing department moves.
  - ✅ **DEEP LINKING**:
    - Added `?personId` URL parameter support to `/org/:orgId/map` for external navigation.

  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED/CREATED**: 25+ files
  - ✅ **COMMITS PUSHED**: Multiple commits covering backend and frontend integration
- **Previous Progress (January 14, 2026 - Session 52)**:
  - ✨ **FEATURE COMPLETE**: Unified Account Management System
  - ✅ **NEW COMPONENTS**:
    - `AccountLayout.tsx` - Central hub for all account settings with tab navigation
    - `ProfileSettings.tsx` - Update user name and email
    - `SecurityCheck.tsx` - Proactive security banner prompting 2FA/Passkey setup
  - ✅ **NAVIGATION IMPROVEMENTS**:
    - Added "Settings" button to OrganizationSelector header (landing page access)
    - Added "Account Settings" link to AdminLayout sidebar
    - Unified routing at `/settings` with sub-routes for Security and Sessions
  - ✅ **BACKEND ENHANCEMENTS**:
    - `PUT /api/auth/profile` - New endpoint for profile updates
    - Applied `authenticateToken` middleware to all 2FA and Passkey routes
    - Fixed CORS configuration for local development (port 5174)
    - Centralized 2FA/Passkey API methods in frontend client
  - 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG FIX #1**: Passkey Registration Failure
    - **Root Cause**: Infinite recursion in `getErrorMessage()` helper in `passkey.ts`
    - Original code: `if (error instanceof Error) return getErrorMessage(error);` (calls itself!)
    - Fixed to: `if (error instanceof Error) return error.message;`
    - This bug caused ALL passkey operations to crash silently
  - 🐛 **BUG FIX #2**: Back Button History Navigation
    - Changed AccountLayout back button from `navigate(-1)` to `navigate('/')`
    - Now always returns to landing page instead of cycling through history
  - 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG FIX #3**: 2FA Login Failure
    - **Root Cause**: `SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_FOREIGNKEY` in audit logs
    - Login flow attempts to log event with `'system'` as org ID
    - Foreign key constraint requires valid organization reference
    - Resulted in "Invalid email or password" error for valid 2FA users
    - **Fix**:
      - Added migration to recreate `audit_logs` table with nullable `organization_id`
      - Updated `audit.service.ts` to pass `null` for system events
      - Updated TypeScript interfaces (`DatabaseUser`, `LoginResult`)
    - **Impact**: Users with 2FA enabled can now log in successfully
  - ✅ **Fixed Passkey Authentication Flow**:
    - **[FIX]** Refactored Passkey/WebAuthn authentication to use stateless cookie-based challenge storage.
    - **[FIX]** Resolved persistent "Authentication flow not started" errors during login.
  - 🧹 **MAINTENANCE**: CI/Lint Fixes
    - **[FIX]** Addressed linting and TypeScript errors in `seed-via-api.ts` and `passkey.service.ts` to ensure clean CI.
    - Fixed type mismatch in `passkey.service.ts` (`allowCredentials`, `excludeCredentials`)
    - Resolved all linting issues for clean CI run
  - 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG FIX #4**: 2FA Silent Redirection Loop
    - **Root Cause**: Race condition between 2FA verification reload and AuthContext initialization.
    - `LoginPage.tsx` performed a full page reload (`window.location.href`) immediately after 2FA success.
    - `AuthContext.tsx` aggressively logged users out if `api.getMe()` failed during initialization (e.g., due to network race).
    - **Fix**:
      - **Frontend**: Switched `LoginPage.tsx` to use `useNavigate` for client-side transition (no reload).
      - **Context**: Updated `AuthContext.tsx` to only force logout on explicit 401/403 errors.
    - **Impact**: Seamless 2FA login experience without silent failures.
  - ✅ **BUILD FIX**: Resolved TypeScript error in `usePasskey.ts`
    - Fixed `PasskeyLoginResult` missing `created_at` property required by `User` type.
    - Updated hook to use shared `User` interface from `types/index.ts`.
  - 📊 **TESTING**:

      - `GET /api/auth/2fa/status` - Check if 2FA is enabled for user
      - `POST /api/auth/2fa/verify` - Verify TOTP token and enable 2FA
      - `POST /api/auth/2fa/disable` - Disable 2FA and clear secret
    - `server/src/services/auth.service.ts` - Enabled 2FA login enforcement:
      - Uncommented `totp_enabled` check in `loginUser()` function
      - Login now redirects to 2FA verification when enabled
      - Refresh token generation delayed until 2FA verification completes
  - 🎯 **IMPACT**:
    - Security Settings page (`/settings/security`) now fully functional
    - Users can enable 2FA with any TOTP authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password)

- **Previous Progress (January 12, 2026 - Session 48 Continued)**:
  - 🌙 **BUG FIX**: ShareModal not respecting dark mode
  - ✅ **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**:
    - "Share Organization" modal displayed in light mode even when dark mode was enabled
    - Component had hardcoded light-only Tailwind classes without `dark:` variants

    - Consistent theming across the entire application
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED**: 1 file (`src/components/admin/ShareModal.tsx`)
  - ✅ **COMMITTED AND PUSHED**: Commit 68fe562
  - 🚨 **CRITICAL CI/CD FIXES**: Resolved GitHub Actions failures in lint and backend test jobs
  - ✅ **ISSUE #1 IDENTIFIED**: Husky not found in CI
    - GitHub Actions failing with `sh: 1: husky: not found` during `cd server && npm ci`
    - Root cause: `prepare` script runs during `npm ci`, tries to execute `husky`
    - Husky is devDependency in root, not available when running `npm ci` in server directory
  - ✅ **FIX #1**: CI-aware prepare script
    - Modified `package.json` prepare script: `"prepare": "node -e \"process.exit(process.env.CI ? 0 : 1)\" || husky"`
    - Script exits successfully (code 0) if `CI` environment variable is set
    - Otherwise runs husky normally for local development
    - Committed (commit: 1b4e164)
    - **Result**: Husky error resolved ✅
  - ✅ **ISSUE #2 IDENTIFIED**: ESLint plugin resolution error in CI
    - GitHub Actions failing with `Cannot find package 'eslint-plugin-react' imported from eslint.config.js`
    - Root cause: NPM workspaces configuration incompatible with project structure
    - Project runs `npm ci` separately in frontend and backend (not a true monorepo)
    - Workspaces was causing dependency hoisting issues
  - ✅ **FIX #2**: Removed workspaces configuration
    - Attempted fix: Removed invalid `'.'` self-reference from workspaces array (commit: 5108de9) - Still failed ❌
    - Final fix: Removed `"workspaces"` field entirely from `package.json` (commit: 8dfd505) ✅
    - Rationale: Project uses multi-package structure, not monorepo
  - ✅ **ISSUE #3 IDENTIFIED**: Scripts broken after workspaces removal
    - `test:all` and `lint:all` scripts used `--workspaces` flag
    - Pre-push hook failed trying to run full test suite
  - ✅ **FIX #3**: Updated test and lint scripts
    - Changed `test:all`: `npm test && cd server && npm test`
    - Changed `lint:all`: `npm run lint && cd server && npm run lint`
    - Committed (commit: 7ace432)
    - **Result**: All tests passing locally and in CI ✅
  - ✅ **DOCUMENTATION UPDATE**:
    - Added "Package Management & Build System" section to `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`
    - Explains multi-package vs. monorepo architecture
    - Documents when to use workspaces vs. separate packages
    - Prevents future regression of this configuration error
    - Committed (commit: 56b5023)
  - 📊 **VALIDATION**:
    - All GitHub Actions jobs passing ✅
      - Lint: 36s
      - Security Audit: 9s

      - Build: 35s
    - Pre-commit and pre-push hooks working ✅
    - Application deployed and healthy at https://orgtree-app.onrender.com ✅
  - 🎯 **IMPACT**:
    - ✅ CI/CD pipeline fully operational
    - ✅ All tests running in both local and CI environments
    - ✅ Package management architecture properly documented
    - ✅ Prevented future workspaces misconfiguration
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED** (3 files):
    - `package.json` - Removed workspaces, updated test/lint scripts, CI-aware prepare
    - `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` - Added package management architecture section
    - `PROGRESS.md` - This update
  - 💡 **LESSONS LEARNED**:
    - Not all multi-package repos need NPM workspaces
    - Workspaces cause hoisting issues when packages should be isolated
    - CI environment detection crucial for dev-only tools like Husky
    - Always match package management to actual build/deploy architecture
  - 📋 **NEXT STEPS**:
    - Monitor CI pipeline stability
    - Continue with planned feature development

- **Previous Progress (January 12, 2026 - Session 48)**:
  - 🚨 **CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT FIX**: Resolved Render deployment failures by reverting Express 5
  - ✅ **ISSUE #1 IDENTIFIED**:
    - Render deployments showing `update_failed` status while GitHub Actions passed
    - Dependabot auto-merged Express 4.22.1 → 5.2.1 (major version upgrade)
    - Express 5 uses newer `path-to-regexp` library that rejects `'*'` syntax
    - Catch-all route `app.get('*', ...)` at `server/src/index.ts:230` crashed server at startup
    - **Runtime error**: `PathError [TypeError]: Missing parameter name at index 1: *`
  - ✅ **ATTEMPT #1**: Fixed path-to-regexp syntax incompatibility
    - `server/src/index.ts` - Changed `app.get('*', ...)` → `app.get('/*', ...)`
    - Committed and deployed (commit: ad91f68)
    - **Result**: Deployment still failed with `update_failed` status ❌
  - ✅ **ISSUE #2 IDENTIFIED**:
    - Build succeeded ✅ but server exited immediately with status 1 ❌
    - No error messages visible in logs (silent failure)
    - GitHub Actions only tests build/lint/test (doesn't start server), so it passed
    - Render deployed successfully but service crashed on startup (health check failed)
    - Express 5 has additional undocumented breaking changes beyond path-to-regexp
  - ✅ **SOLUTION APPLIED**: Reverted Express 5 → 4
    - `server/package.json` - Reverted Express 5.2.1 → 4.22.1
    - `server/src/index.ts` - Restored catch-all route `'/*'` → `'*'` (Express 4 syntax)
    - Committed and deployed (commit: 39148e8)
    - **Result**: Awaiting deployment confirmation ⏳
  - 📊 **VALIDATION**:
    - All 423 backend tests passing ✅
    - All 103 frontend tests passing ✅
    - All linters passing (ESLint + Prettier) ✅
    - GitHub Actions CI/CD both successful ✅
    - `npm install` successful (8 packages added, 37 removed with Express 4)
  - 🎯 **IMPACT**:
    - ✅ Restored working deployment configuration
    - ✅ Application should deploy successfully again
    - ⚠️ Express 5 upgrade deferred - requires dedicated migration effort
    - ✅ SPA routing continues to work correctly with Express 4
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED** (3 files):
    - `server/package.json` - Reverted Express version
    - `server/package-lock.json` - Dependency updates for Express 4
    - `server/src/index.ts` - Restored Express 4 catch-all syntax
  - 💡 **LESSONS LEARNED**:
    - Express 5 has breaking changes beyond the official migration guide
    - Silent production failures are harder to diagnose than build failures
    - GitHub Actions should test server startup, not just compilation
    - Dependabot should require manual approval for major version upgrades
    - PROGRESS.md line 334 was correct: "Skipped Express 5 upgrade (requires dedicated migration)"
  - 📋 **NEXT STEPS**:
    - Configure Dependabot to prevent auto-merge of major version upgrades
    - Add server startup tests to CI pipeline
    - Plan dedicated Express 5 migration with comprehensive testing

- **Previous Progress (January 11, 2026 - Session 47)**:
  - 🚨 **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Restored OrgMap edge rendering - PERMANENT SOLUTION
  - ✅ **ISSUE IDENTIFIED** (Recurring bug from Sessions 25, 37):
    - Department hierarchy lines not displaying in organization chart
    - Root cause: Backend `org.service.ts` was aliasing database fields to camelCase
    - `parent_id as parentId` → Frontend checks `dept.parent_id` → undefined → no edges created
    - Silent failure: departments rendered correctly, but connection lines disappeared
    - This is a **data contract mismatch** between backend and frontend
  - ✅ **FIXES APPLIED** (6 files):
    - `server/src/services/org.service.ts` - Removed ALL camelCase aliases in SQL queries
      - Changed "parent_id as parentId" → "parent_id" (CRITICAL for edges)
      - Changed "organization_id as organizationId" → "organization_id"
      - Changed "sort_order as sortOrder" → "sort_order"
      - Applied to departments, people, and organizations queries
    - Updated TypeScript interfaces to enforce snake_case (Department, Person, OrganizationResult)
    - `server/src/services/org.service.test.ts` - Fixed test assertions to expect snake_case
    - `server/scripts/seed-large-dataset.ts` - Fixed lint errors (performance import, unused vars)
    - `server/scripts/seed-via-api.ts` - Fixed lint errors (any types, fetch global)
  - 🛡️ **PREVENTION MEASURES** (This CANNOT happen again):
    - **New validation test suite**: `server/src/services/__field-naming-validation.test.ts`
      - 7 critical tests that verify snake_case field names
      - Explicitly checks `parent_id` exists (critical for OrgMap edges)
      - Tests fail if camelCase variants exist (parentId, organizationId, etc.)
      - **If these tests fail, edges will break - DO NOT IGNORE**
    - **Comprehensive documentation**: `FIELD_NAMING_CONVENTION.md` (250+ lines)
      - Explains why snake_case is mandatory for database fields
      - Provides correct/incorrect code examples
      - Documents history of this recurring bug
      - Required reading for all backend service modifications
    - **Inline code comments**: Added CRITICAL warnings in org.service.ts explaining OrgMap dependency
  - 📊 **TESTING**:
    - All 328 backend tests passing ✅ (+7 validation tests)
    - All 103 frontend tests passing ✅
    - Production build successful ✅
    - All linters passing (ESLint + Prettier) ✅
  - 🎯 **IMPACT**:

    - `README.md` - Updated prerequisites to Node 20+
    - `PROGRESS.md` - Updated prerequisites to Node 20+ and dependency updates
    - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Updated CI workflow to Node 20
  - ⬆️ **NODE.JS VERSION REQUIREMENT UPDATE**:
    - Updated project to require Node.js 20+ (Node 18 reached end-of-life April 2025)
    - Added `engines` field to both `package.json` files (root and server) requiring Node >=20.0.0, npm >=9.0.0
    - Created `.nvmrc` file for automatic Node version management
    - Updated `README.md` prerequisites documentation
    - Updated `PROGRESS.md` prerequisites section
    - **Updated CI workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) from Node 18 to Node 20 (all 5 jobs)
    - Resolves npm dependency warnings (better-sqlite3, vite, vitest all require Node 20+)
    - Eliminates CI/CD deprecation warnings by aligning workflow Node version with dependency requirements
  - 📦 **BACKEND DEPENDENCY UPDATES**:
    - Updated **5 outdated packages** to latest versions (all safe, API-compatible updates)
    - **@types/node**: 25.0.3 → 25.0.6 (patch - type definitions)
    - **better-sqlite3**: 12.5.0 → 12.6.0 (minor - performance improvements, FTS5 enhancements)

      - Same API, hashes remain 100% compatible with previous versions
      - Fixes security issues in versions < 5.0.0 (password truncation, NUL handling)
    - ⚠️ **Skipped Express 5** upgrade (4.22.1 → 5.2.1) - requires dedicated migration due to breaking changes
    - ✅ All 423 backend tests passing after updates
  - 💡 **LESSON LEARNED**:
    - This bug has occurred 3 times (Sessions 25, 37, 47) during refactoring
    - Backend MUST return snake_case to match frontend types
    - Database schema (snake_case) → Backend → Frontend (no transformation)
    - Automated validation is the only way to prevent architectural regressions

- **Previous Session (January 11, 2026 - Session 46)**:
  - 🚀 **PERFORMANCE TESTING COMPLETE**: Successfully benchmarked application with 1,000+ records
  - ✅ **API SEEDING STRATEGY**:
    - Developed `server/scripts/seed-via-api.ts` to populate data via HTTP calls
    - Handles authentication, CSRF tokens, and organization creation automatically
    - Successfully seeded **1,002 people** across **23 departments**
  - ✅ **BENCHMARK RESULTS**:
    - Created `e2e/performance.spec.ts` for automated load time measurement
    - **Total Load Time**: **467ms** (from navigation to full render)
    - **Shell Load**: 96ms
    - **Data Render**: 371ms
    - Verified on Chromium with 1,002 visible records
  - ✅ **ENVIRONMENT OPTIMIZATIONS**:
    - Relaxed backend rate limits in development mode (`authLimiter`) to allow seeding
    - Fixed `package.json` dev script compatibility issue with `tsx` flags
    - Points seed script directly to backend port 3001 for automated reliability
  - 📊 **FILES MODIFIED/CREATED**:
    - `server/scripts/seed-via-api.ts` (New) - API-based data generator
    - `e2e/performance.spec.ts` (Refined) - Playwright benchmark script
    - `server/src/routes/auth.ts` - Relaxed rate limits for dev
    - `server/package.json` - Fixed `npm run dev` script
  - 🎯 **IMPACT**:
    - Confirmed application scalability for standard-sized organizations (~1000 records)
    - Established repeatable benchmarking infrastructure for future optimizations
    - Identified "virtualization" as the next performance milestone for 5k+ records

- **Previous Session (January 11, 2026 - Session 45)**:
  - 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Fixed bulk department delete showing false errors for cascade-deleted children
  - ✅ **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**:
    - When bulk deleting all departments, users saw errors like "Department not found in this organization"
    - Root cause: `softDeleteDepartment()` cascades and deletes all child departments when a parent is deleted
    - When the loop later processed those child departments, they were already soft-deleted
    - The query filtered `deleted_at IS NULL`, so they weren't found, triggering false errors
  - ✅ **FIX APPLIED** (1 backend file):
    - `server/src/services/bulk.service.ts` - Added check for already-deleted departments
    - First checks if department exists in organization (regardless of deleted_at status)
    - If exists but already soft-deleted → skip silently (was cascade-deleted by parent)
    - If doesn't exist at all → mark as failed with error
    - Only process departments that exist and aren't already deleted
  - ✅ **TESTING**:
    - All 321 backend tests passing ✅
    - Bulk service tests verify cascading deletion still works correctly
  - 🎯 **IMPACT**:
    - Users can now bulk delete all departments without seeing false errors
    - Cascade deletion still works as intended (deletes children with parents)
    - Error messages only shown for truly missing departments
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED**:
    - `server/src/services/bulk.service.ts` - Added cascade-aware deletion check (18 lines added)
  - 🧪 **TEST COVERAGE EXPANSION (PHASE 2 & 3)**:
    - **Target**: `src/utils` and `src/hooks` directories
    - **`src/utils` Coverage**:
      - Statements: 49.68% → **93.03%**
      - Functions: 36.36% → **89.09%**
      - Added tests for `layoutEngine.ts`, `csvExport.ts`, `csvImport.ts`, `exportUtils.ts` (mocking jsPDF/html-to-image)
    - **`src/hooks` Coverage**:
      - Statements: 13.11% → **65.57%**
      - Functions: 23.8% → **71.42%**
      - Added tests for `useSearch.ts` (debouncing), `useRealtimeUpdates.ts` (socket mocking), `usePasskey.ts` (WebAuthn mocking)
  - 🛠️ **BUILD PROCESS HARDENING**:
    - **Linting Enforcement**: `npm run build` now runs `npm run lint` and `npm run format:check` _before_ compilation
    - **Verification**: Confirmed build failures on lint/format errors to prevent technical debt accumulation
  - 📊 **FILES MODIFIED/CREATED**:
    - `package.json` - Updated build script
    - `src/utils/*.test.ts` - 4 new test files
    - `src/hooks/*.test.ts` - 3 new test files

- **Previous Session (January 11, 2026 - Session 44)**:
  - 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Fixed XML import not extracting full department hierarchy
  - ✅ **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**:
    - GEDS XML imports were only creating 1-2 levels of departments instead of full 6+ level hierarchies
    - Frontend parser looked for `<n>` tags but GEDS XML files use `<name>` tags
    - This caused parser to fail extracting department hierarchy from `<orgStructure>` section
    - Parser fell back to simple department/organization fields, losing all sub-departments
  - ✅ **FIX APPLIED** (1 frontend file):
    - `src/utils/xmlImport.ts` - Changed `getElementsByTagName('n')` to `getElementsByTagName('name')`
    - Now correctly extracts all department levels from orgStructure
  - 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE**:
    - Original Node.js script used `xml2js` library which converts element names to properties
    - Browser's DOMParser keeps actual tag names (doesn't convert `<name>` to property)
    - Comment in original script said "xml2js parses <n> as 'name' property" but this was misleading
    - XML actually has `<name>` tags, not `<n>` tags
  - ✅ **TESTING**:
    - Created comprehensive test suite (`src/utils/xmlImport.test.ts`) with 3 tests
    - Tests verify full hierarchy extraction, fallback behavior, and duplicate detection
    - All 62 frontend tests passing ✅ (59 existing + 3 new)
    - All 321 backend tests passing ✅
  - 📊 **GITHUB METADATA UPDATE**:
    - Added repository description: "Full-stack organizational directory and visualization platform..."
    - Added 12 topics: react, nodejs, express, sqlite, typescript, organizational-chart, etc.
    - Added homepage URL: https://orgtree.onrender.com
  - 🎯 **IMPACT**:
    - GEDS XML imports now create full department hierarchies (6+ levels)
    - Sub-departments correctly imported and organized
    - Maintains all organizational structure from source XML files
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED/CREATED**:
    - `src/utils/xmlImport.ts` - 1 line changed (critical fix)
    - `src/utils/xmlImport.test.ts` - New comprehensive test file (145 lines)

- **Previous Session (January 11, 2026 - Session 43)**:
  - 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Fixed case-sensitive duplicate detection allowing duplicate records
  - ✅ **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**:
    - XML/CSV imports could create duplicate people with different email casing (e.g., "john@example.com" vs "John@Example.com")
    - Regular people creation API had NO duplicate checking at all
    - Department and person name comparisons were also case-sensitive
    - SQLite's = operator is case-sensitive by default
  - ✅ **FIXES APPLIED** (2 files):
    - `server/src/routes/import.ts` - Updated all duplicate checks to use `LOWER(TRIM())` for case-insensitive, whitespace-tolerant comparisons
    - `server/src/services/people.service.ts` - Added duplicate detection to `createPerson()` and `updatePerson()` functions (was completely missing)
  - 📊 **DUPLICATE DETECTION RULES**:
    - For people with emails: Check email uniqueness within entire organization (case-insensitive)
    - For people without emails: Check name uniqueness within department (case-insensitive)
    - For departments: Check name uniqueness within same parent (case-insensitive)
  - ✅ **TESTING**:
    - All 321 backend tests passing ✅
    - All 59 frontend tests passing ✅
    - Build verification successful

  - 🚀 **READY FOR PHASE 2**: Backend service edge cases and low-coverage areas

- **Previous Session (January 10, 2026 - Session 37)**:
  - 🚨 **CRITICAL FIX**: Resolved infinite loop causing Organization Map to not load
  - 🔧 **Root Cause**: Circular dependency in useCallback hooks
    - `loadData` depended on `handleToggleExpand`
    - `handleToggleExpand` depended on `edges`
    - `loadData` updated `edges` via `setEdges()`
    - This created an infinite re-render cycle
  - ✅ **Solution Implemented**:
    - Removed `handleToggleExpand` and `handleSelectPerson` from `loadData` dependencies
    - Removed callback injection from all layout functions (`handleToggleExpand`, `handleExpandAll`, `handleCollapseAll`, `handleToggleLayout`)
    - Callbacks now exclusively added via `nodesWithHighlight` useMemo (existing pattern)
    - Memoized real-time update callbacks to prevent unnecessary re-subscriptions
  - 🔧 **XML Import Name Format Fix**: Corrected name order in GEDS XML imports
    - **Issue**: Names were imported as "[Last Name], [First Name]" instead of "[First Name] [Last Name]"
    - **Root Cause**: Code was using the `fullName` field directly from XML (which is in "Last, First" format)
    - **Solution**: Always construct name from firstName + lastName fields in correct order
    - **Impact**: All imported names now display correctly as "First Last"
  - 🛡️ **Duplicate Department Prevention**: Backend now prevents duplicate departments
    - **Issue**: Importing same data twice created duplicate departments
    - **Root Cause**: Backend only checked for duplicate people, not departments
    - **Solution**: Added department duplicate check by name + parent_id combination
    - **Behavior**: If department exists, reuses existing ID instead of creating duplicate
    - **Metrics**: Tracks `departmentsCreated` vs `departmentsReused` separately
    - **Impact**: Safe to re-import data without creating duplicates
  - 🔧 **Bulk Operations UI Refresh Bug**: Fixed bulk operations not refreshing UI
    - **Issue**: Bulk delete/move/edit showed success dialog but UI didn't refresh - counts stayed same
    - **Root Cause**: Frontend using wrong API response field names
      - Code was checking `result.success` (boolean) and `result.failed` instead of `result.deletedCount`, `result.updatedCount`, etc. (numbers)
      - Condition `if (result.success > 0)` evaluated to `if (true > 0)` = false
      - This prevented `loadData()` from being called, so UI never refreshed
    - **Solution**: Updated all bulk operation handlers to use correct field names
      - PersonManager: `handleBulkDelete`, `handleBulkMove`, `handleBulkEdit`
      - DepartmentManager: `handleBulkDelete`, `handleBulkEdit`
    - **Impact**: All bulk operations now correctly refresh the UI after completion
  - 📝 **Files Modified**:
    - `src/components/OrgMap.tsx` - Refactored callback dependency chain
    - `src/utils/xmlImport.ts` - Fixed name construction order
    - `server/src/routes/import.ts` - Added duplicate department detection
    - `src/types/index.ts` - Added departmentsReused field to CSVImportResult

    - `src/components/admin/PersonManager.tsx` - Fixed bulk operation field names
    - `src/components/admin/DepartmentManager.tsx` - Fixed bulk operation field names

  **January 8, 2026 - Critical Bug Fix #2: Org Chart Lines Restored (Session 25 Part 2)** 🚨🔗:
  - 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG IDENTIFIED**: Department hierarchy lines not showing in Organization Map
  - 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**:
    - First fix (1732bec) corrected department.service.ts and people.service.ts
    - However, org.service.ts (used by OrgMap component) was missed
    - Frontend transformToFlowData() checks `dept.parent_id` to create edges
    - Backend org.service.ts still returned `dept.parentId` (camelCase)
    - When parent_id was undefined, no edges were created
    - Result: Departments rendered but no connecting lines displayed
  - ✅ **FIXES APPLIED**:
    - Fixed org.service.ts getOrganizationById() department query (3 fields: parent_id, organization_id, sort_order)
    - Fixed org.service.ts getOrganizationById() people query (3 fields: department_id, sort_order, created_at)
    - Fixed org.service.ts all organization queries (3 fields: created_by_id, created_at, updated_at)
    - Updated org.service.test.ts assertions (createdById → created_by_id)
  - 📊 **TESTING**:
    - All 97 backend tests passing
    - All 32 frontend tests passing
    - Production build verified successful
  - 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT**:
    - Pushed commit `da076d3` to main branch
    - GitHub Actions CI/CD triggered
    - Deployed to production at <https://orgtree-app.onrender.com>
  - 💡 **IMPACT**:
    - Department hierarchy lines now display correctly
    - Parent-child relationships visualized with smooth arrows
    - OrgMap visualization fully functional
    - Core feature of OrgTree restored
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED** (2 files):
    - `server/src/services/org.service.ts` (fixed 3 queries)
    - `server/src/services/org.service.test.ts` (fixed 1 assertion)
  - 🎯 **PREVENTION**: Complete field naming consistency now achieved across ALL backend services

  **January 8, 2026 - Critical Bug Fix #1: Departments Now Visible (Session 25 Part 1)** 🚨🔧:
  - 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG IDENTIFIED**: Departments not visible in Departments tab
  - 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**:
    - TypeScript migration (Session 19) introduced field naming mismatch
    - Backend services returned camelCase fields (organizationId, parentId, sortOrder, etc.)
    - Frontend types expected snake_case fields (organization_id, parent_id, sort_order, etc.)
    - This caused silent data parsing failures - data was received but unrecognized
    - React rendered empty lists instead of crashing, hiding the bug
  - ✅ **FIXES APPLIED**:
    - Reverted `department.service.ts` to return snake_case from SQL queries
    - Reverted `people.service.ts` to return snake_case from SQL queries
    - Fixed `people.ts` route type assertion (departmentId → department_id)
    - Updated `department.service.test.ts` field name assertions
    - Updated `people.service.test.ts` field name assertions
  - 📊 **TESTING**:
    - All 97 backend tests passing (including updated test assertions)
    - All 32 frontend tests passing
    - Production build verified successful
  - 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT**:
    - Pushed commit `1732bec` to main branch
    - GitHub Actions CI/CD triggered
    - Deployed to production at <https://orgtree-app.onrender.com>
  - 💡 **IMPACT**:
    - Departments now display correctly in UI
    - Department creation/update/delete operations restored
    - People associations with departments working
    - Tree view, search, and bulk operations functioning
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED** (5 files):
    - `server/src/services/department.service.ts`
    - `server/src/services/people.service.ts`
    - `server/src/routes/people.ts`
    - `server/src/services/department.service.test.ts`
    - `server/src/services/people.service.test.ts`
  - 🎯 **LESSON LEARNED**: When migrating to TypeScript, maintain consistency between database schema (snake_case), backend responses, and frontend types to prevent silent parsing failures

  **January 7, 2026 - Code Cleanup, Testing & Compliance (Session 22)** 🧹🧪⚖️:

    - **Commits**: 3 commits (main migration + 2 fixes)
    - **Time**: ~4 hours (estimated based on agent work)
  - 🎯 **KEY TECHNICAL PATTERNS ESTABLISHED**:
    - **Backend**: All imports use `.js` extensions for ES modules
    - **Express**: Route handlers return `Promise<void>`, not data types
    - **Database**: Query results typed with `as Type | undefined` assertions
    - **SQLite**: Boolean conversion with `Boolean(value)` for 0/1 values
    - **Socket.IO**: Event handlers use `(...args: unknown[])` with type assertions

  - 🚀 **DEPLOYED**: All commits pushed to GitHub, production build successful
  - 🎉 **STATUS**: TypeScript migration 100% complete with enterprise-grade type safety

  **January 7, 2026 - CI Pipeline Fixes (Session 20)** ✅:
  - ✅ **CI PIPELINE NOW PASSING**: All GitHub Actions checks green
  - ✅ **RENDER DEPLOYMENT FIX**:
    - **Issue**: `tsx: not found` error in production
    - **Root Cause**: `tsx` was in devDependencies, but Render runs `npm install --production`
    - **Fix**: Moved `tsx` to dependencies in server/package.json
    - **Result**: Production deployment successful, server running
  - ✅ **BACKEND ESLINT FIXES** (74 errors → 0):
    - **@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any**: Replaced all `any` types with proper TypeScript types
    - **Routes**: Changed `error: any` to `error: unknown` with type guards
    - **Services**: Created proper interfaces (DeletedPerson, MovedPerson, BulkEditFields, etc.)
    - **Socket Events**: Changed `Record<string, any>` to `Record<string, unknown>`
    - **Test Files**: Converted `require()` to `await import()` for ES modules
    - **Global Types**: Added eslint-disable for empty interface (required for Express augmentation)
  - ✅ **PRETTIER FORMATTING** (30 files formatted):
    - Applied consistent code style across all backend TypeScript files
    - Fixed inconsistent indentation, line breaks, and quote styles
    - Ensured CI format check passes
  - ✅ **KEY INSIGHT: Pre-commit vs CI**:
    - Pre-commit hooks use `lint-staged` (only checks staged files)
    - CI pipeline lints the entire codebase
    - Files modified before staging weren't checked by pre-commit but caught by CI
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED**:
    - server/package.json (tsx moved to dependencies)
    - 30 backend TypeScript files (Prettier formatting)
    - 15+ route files (any → unknown type fixes)
    - 10+ service files (proper interfaces)
    - 3 test files (require → import)
  - 🎯 **FINAL CI STATUS**: All checks passing ✅
    - ESLint: 0 errors
    - Prettier: All files formatted
    - Tests: 76 passing (44 backend + 32 frontend)
    - Build: Successful
    - Type-check: 0 errors

    - Health check verification with retry logic (up to 10 attempts over 3 minutes) ✓ VERIFIED
    - Deployment summary with commit details
    - **Deployment Time**: ~20 seconds (when service is warm), up to 3 minutes (cold start)
  - ✅ **CRITICAL FIX - Frontend Tests Hanging** (Session 16):
    - **Problem**: Frontend tests hung indefinitely in CI with ES module require() error
    - **Root Cause**: jsdom's dependency on html-encoding-sniffer incompatible with @exodus/bytes ES module
    - **Solution**: Switched from jsdom to happy-dom test environment
    - **Result**: Tests now complete in 21-28 seconds (from indefinite hanging)
    - **Files Modified**: `vitest.config.js` (changed environment, removed deps.inline workaround)
    - **Packages Added**: happy-dom (lighter, better ES module support than jsdom)
  - ✅ **CD HEALTH CHECK FIX** (Session 16):
    - **Problem**: Health check failing with HTTP 502 after 60s wait
    - **Root Cause**: Render free tier deployments can take 2-3 minutes (cold starts)
    - **Solution**: Implemented retry logic with 10 attempts over 3+ minutes
    - **Result**: CD workflow now passes consistently (21s when warm, handles cold starts)
    - **Files Modified**: `.github/workflows/cd.yml` (replaced single wait with retry loop)
    - **Retry Strategy**: 10 attempts × 20s intervals = up to 200s total wait time
  - ✅ **SENTRY ERROR MONITORING FIX** (Session 16):
    - **Problem**: Server crash loop in production with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'requestHandler')"
    - **Root Cause**: Using deprecated Sentry v7/v8 API (Sentry.Handlers) with Sentry v10+
    - **Solution**: Updated to Sentry v10+ API using `Sentry.setupExpressErrorHandler(app)`
    - **Result**: Server starts successfully, Sentry capturing errors in production
    - **Files Modified**:
      - `server/src/sentry.js` - Removed handlers return, simplified to Sentry.init() only
      - `server/src/index.js` - Use Sentry.setupExpressErrorHandler() for v10+ API

  - `server/.env.example`
- **FILES DELETED**:
  - `src/components/admin/UserSearchSelect.jsx` (no longer needed)
- **DEPENDENCIES**: Added `resend` package for email delivery
- **ENVIRONMENT**: Requires `RESEND_API_KEY`, `APP_URL` for email functionality
- **USER FLOW**:
  1. Admin enters email address in Add Member modal
  2. If user exists -> Added immediately
  3. If user doesn't exist -> "Send Invitation" button appears
  4. Invitation email sent with 7-day expiry
  5. Recipient accepts via `/invite/:token` page
- **IMPACT**: Reliable team collaboration without broken search dependency
- **FOLLOW-UP FEATURES**:
  - **Pending Invitations Display**: Added section in ShareModal showing all pending invitations
    - View email, role, invited by, and sent date
    - Cancel invitations with trash button
    - Auto-refreshes when new invitations are sent

  - **Production Setup & Debugging**:
    - Fixed invitation link generation (APP_URL configuration)
    - Configured Resend API integration (RESEND_API_KEY)
    - Fixed invitation acceptance route (moved to public routes)
- **CRITICAL FIXES**:
  - ✅ Invitation links were showing placeholder URL `your-app.onrender.com`
    - Solution: Added `APP_URL` environment variable with actual Render URL
  - ✅ Invitation emails not sending with "email_not_configured" error
    - Solution: Added `RESEND_API_KEY` to Render environment variables
  - ✅ "Access token required" error when viewing invitations
    - Solution: Moved `GET /invitations/:token` to `GET /public/invitation/:token`

  - Requires `APP_URL` set to actual Render URL (e.g., `https://orgtree-app.onrender.com`)
  - Emails from `onboarding@resend.dev` may go to spam (custom domain recommended for production)
- **KNOWN LIMITATIONS**:
  - Sandbox mode: Resend only delivers to verified email addresses unless custom domain is configured
  - Invitation expiry: 7 days (hardcoded)
  - One pending invitation per email per organization (prevents duplicates)
- **CRITICAL BUG FIX - Invitation Acceptance**:
  - ✅ **BUG FIXED**: Invitation acceptance now properly creates members and updates status
  - ✅ **ROOT CAUSE**: Missing `await` keyword in route handler caused response before DB operations completed
  - ✅ **SYMPTOMS**: Invitations showed as "pending" after acceptance, users had no access to organization
  - ✅ **SOLUTION**:
    - Added `await` to `acceptInvitation` call in route handler
    - Added validation to verify member insertion succeeds (checks `changes > 0`)
    - Added validation to verify invitation status update succeeds (checks `changes > 0`)
    - Throws errors if database operations fail
  - ✅ **FILES MODIFIED**:
    - `server/src/routes/invitations.js`: Added await keyword
    - `server/src/services/invitation.service.js`: Added database operation validation
  - 📝 **IMPACT**: Invitation acceptance now properly adds users as members and marks invitations as accepted

**December 24, 2025 - Infinite Password Change Loop Fix** 🔐:

- ✅ **CRITICAL BUG FIXED**: Users no longer stuck in infinite password change redirect loop
- ✅ **ROOT CAUSE**: `getUserById` function didn't return `must_change_password` field
- ✅ **SYMPTOMS**: After changing temporary password and logging back in, users redirected to change password page infinitely
- ✅ **TECHNICAL ISSUE**:
  - User object missing `mustChangePassword` field after login
  - ProtectedRoute couldn't determine if password was actually changed
  - Field was being cleared in DB but not returned in API responses
- ✅ **SOLUTION**:
  - Added `must_change_password` to `getUserById` SELECT query
  - Converted `getUserById` to return camelCase fields (`mustChangePassword`)
  - Added validation for password UPDATE query (verifies `changes > 0`)
  - Returns error if password update fails
- ✅ **FILES MODIFIED**:
  - `server/src/services/auth.service.js`: Updated getUserById to include and format must_change_password
  - `server/src/routes/auth.js`: Added validation for password update operation
- 📝 **IMPACT**: Temporary password flow now works correctly - users can change password and access the app

**December 23, 2025 - User Search Bug Fix** 🐛:

- ✅ **BUG FIXED**: User search in collaboration feature now works correctly
- ✅ **ROOT CAUSE**: Express route conflict - `/api/users/search` was matching `/api/users/:id` in superuser-only users.js router
- ✅ **SOLUTION**: Renamed route from `/users/search` to `/members/search`
- ✅ **FILES MODIFIED**:
  - `server/src/routes/members.js`: Changed route path
  - `src/api/client.js`: Updated API endpoint URL
  - `src/components/admin/UserSearchSelect.jsx`: Cleaned up debug logs
- ✅ **DEBUG CLEANUP**: Removed console.log statements from previous debugging session

  - src/api/client.js
  - src/components/admin/UserSearchSelect.jsx
  - src/components/admin/AddMemberModal.jsx
  - src/components/admin/ShareModal.jsx
- 📝 **NEXT STEPS**: User to test with browser console open (F12) to diagnose issue
- 📝 **IMPACT**: Comprehensive logging will help identify exactly where user search fails

**December 22, 2025 - Multi-User Collaboration Feature** 🎉:

- ✅ **MAJOR FEATURE**: Implemented complete multi-user collaboration system for organizations
- ✅ **PERMISSION SYSTEM**: Four-tier role hierarchy (Owner > Admin > Editor > Viewer)
  - **Owner**: Original creator, permanent admin with full control
  - **Admin**: Can manage members, sharing settings, and all content
  - **Editor**: Can create, edit, and delete departments and people
  - **Viewer**: Read-only access to organization

- 📝 **IMPACT**: Improves navigation and makes user role immediately visible across all pages

**December 22, 2025 - Rate Limiter Configuration Fix**:

- ✅ **CRITICAL PRODUCTION FIX**: Removed unsupported `trustProxy` option from rate limiters
- ✅ **ROOT CAUSE**: express-rate-limit version doesn't support `trustProxy` configuration option
- ✅ **ERROR**: ValidationError: Unexpected configuration option: trustProxy (ERR_ERL_UNKNOWN_OPTION)
- ✅ **SOLUTION**: Removed `trustProxy: true` from both authLimiter and passwordResetLimiter
- ✅ **EXPLANATION**: `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` in main server file handles proxy trust globally
- ✅ **FILES MODIFIED**:
  - server/src/routes/auth.js (removed line 17)
  - server/src/routes/users.js (removed line 23)
- ✅ **IMPACT**: Fixes server startup crash in production on Render
- 📝 **NOTE**: This was incorrectly added in commit 00da4a9 based on misunderstanding of rate limiter library

**December 22, 2025 - Create User + Force Password Change Feature**:

- **MAJOR FEATURE**: Superusers can create new users with auto-generated temporary passwords
- **MAJOR FEATURE**: Users must change password on first login after creation or password reset
- **Backend Changes**:
  - Added `must_change_password` column migration to users table
  - Created `createAdminUser` function generating cryptographic 12-char temporary passwords
  - Updated `resetUserPassword` to set `must_change_password` flag to true
  - Updated `loginUser` to return `mustChangePassword` field in user object
  - Added POST `/api/users` endpoint for creating users (superuser only)
  - Added POST `/api/auth/change-password` endpoint for password changes (authenticated)
- **Frontend Changes**:
  - Created CreateUserModal component with two-step flow (form → success with temp password display)
  - Created ChangePasswordPage component for forced password changes
  - Updated UserManagement with "Create User" button and modal integration
  - Updated ProtectedRoute to redirect to `/change-password` if `mustChangePassword` is true
  - Added `/change-password` route to App.jsx
  - Added `createUser` and `changePassword` API methods to client.js
- **User Flow**:
  1. Superuser creates new user via Create User button
  2. System generates 12-char cryptographic temporary password
  3. Temporary password shown once with copy-to-clipboard functionality
  4. New user logs in with temporary password
  5. User immediately redirected to `/change-password` (cannot access app)
  6. After changing password, user logged out and must log in again with new password
  7. `must_change_password` flag cleared, user gains full app access
- **Security Features**:
  - Temporary passwords are cryptographically random (12 alphanumeric characters)
  - Password change requires authentication (can't bypass)
  - Users locked out of app until password changed
  - Password reset also triggers forced password change
  - Minimum password length: 6 characters
  - Passwords hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- **Files Modified**: 5 backend files, 4 frontend files
- **Files Created**: 2 new components (CreateUserModal, ChangePasswordPage)
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing User Hierarchy feature

**December 22, 2025 - User Hierarchy / Super User Feature + Production Fix**:

- **Backend Changes**:
  - Added role-checking middleware (`requireRole`, `requireSuperuser`, `requireAdminOrAbove`)
  - Created `users.service.js` with full CRUD operations for user management
  - Created `users.js` routes with 6 superuser-only endpoints (list, get, update, change role, reset password, delete)
  - Updated default role from 'admin' to 'user' for new signups
  - Added rate limiting for password reset endpoint
  - **PRODUCTION FIX**: Added `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` and `trustProxy: true` to rate limiters to fix rate limiting behind Render's proxy
- **Frontend Changes**:
  - Added role helpers to AuthContext (`isSuperuser`, `isAdmin`, `canManageUsers`)
  - Updated ProtectedRoute with `requiredRole` prop and role hierarchy checking
  - Created `/admin` route with SuperuserLayout for system administration
  - Created UserManagement page with search, filter, and CRUD operations
  - Created UserForm modal for editing user details and roles

- **Security Features**:
  - Cannot change own role (prevents lock-out)
  - Cannot delete own account
  - Cryptographically secure temporary password generation
  - All role checks enforced server-side
  - Rate limiting on password reset
- **Files Modified**: 9 files (added trust proxy fix)
- **Files Created**: 5 new files
- **Database Path in Production**: `/opt/render/project/src/data/production.db`
- **SQL Command to Promote Superuser**:

  ```bash
  sqlite3 /opt/render/project/src/data/production.db "UPDATE users SET role = 'superuser' WHERE email = 'YOUR_EMAIL';"
  ```

- 🎯 **IMPACT**: Reduces cognitive load and ensures consistent development practices

**December 22, 2025 - Mobile Scrolling Fix**:

- ✅ **CRITICAL UX FIX**: Fixed mobile scrolling in department node people lists
- ✅ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: React Flow's panOnDrag was intercepting touch events on iPhone Safari
- ✅ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: Added CSS touch-action: pan-y property to scrollable containers
- ✅ **FILES MODIFIED**:
  - Added `.touch-pan-y` utility class to src/index.css
  - Applied class to people list container in src/components/DepartmentNode.jsx
- ✅ **TESTING APPROACH**: Deployed directly to production (low-risk CSS-only change)
- ✅ **IMPACT**: Users can now scroll people lists on mobile without triggering canvas pan
- ✅ **PRESERVED FUNCTIONALITY**: Canvas panning, pinch-to-zoom, and all touch gestures still work
- 📝 **PLANNING**: Used comprehensive plan mode exploration before implementation

## 📋 Next Session Planning

### Completed Today (January 19, 2026)

| Session | Task                                         | Status      | Duration |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| 28      | Edit & Create Contacts from Organization Map | ✅ Complete | ~15 min  |

**Total**: 1 feature implementation

### Session 28 Details - Edit & Create Contacts from OrgMap (January 19, 2026)

**Request**: Enable users to edit and create contacts directly from the Organization Map view

**Implementation**:

- Added "Edit" button to DetailPanel (pencil icon) - opens PersonForm modal with person data pre-filled
- Added "Add Person" button to DepartmentNode (UserPlus icon) - opens PersonForm modal with department pre-selected
- Both buttons only visible to users with editor+ permissions (owner, admin, editor)
- Form supports changing department (moving person to different department)
- Real-time updates via Socket.IO after save

**Files Modified**:

- `src/components/DetailPanel.tsx` - Added `onEdit` prop and edit button in header
- `src/components/DepartmentNode.tsx` - Added `onAddPerson` prop and add person button in header
- `src/components/OrgMap.tsx` - Added form state management, permission checking, and PersonForm modal integration

**Key Technical Details**:

- Permission check uses `org.role` from API response (owner/admin/editor can edit)
- PersonForm reused from admin panel - handles both create and edit modes
- `stopPropagation()` on add button prevents triggering department expand/collapse
- Form closes DetailPanel when editing to avoid UI overlap

---

### Session 27 Details - SecurityCheck Relocation (January 17, 2026)

**Request**: Move the security prompt from organization dashboard to landing page

**Change**: Relocated `SecurityCheck` component so users see it once after login rather than inside each organization

**Files Modified**:

- `src/components/admin/Dashboard.tsx` - Removed SecurityCheck import and usage
- `src/components/OrganizationSelector.tsx` - Added SecurityCheck to main content area

**Behavior**:

- Security prompt (2FA/Passkeys recommendation) now appears on "Your Organizations" page
- Uses `sessionStorage` to track dismissal (resets each browser session)
- No longer appears redundantly within each organization

**Commit**: `676c5a4`

---

### Session 26 Details - Search Navigation Fix (January 16, 2026)

**Problem**: Search in Org Map was showing names but not navigating to them when selected

**Root Cause**: Stale closure issue in `handleSearchSelect` function:

1. When searching for a person, code uses `setTimeout` to wait for department expansion
2. The callback captured stale `nodes` reference from when it was created
3. After `handleToggleExpand` updated state, the callback still used old nodes array
4. Node lookup failed or used outdated position data

**Solution**: Used ref pattern to track current nodes:

- Created `nodesRef` to always reference current nodes state
- Updated setTimeout callbacks to use `nodesRef.current` instead of `nodes`
- Applied fix to both `handleSearchSelect` and URL parameter handler

**Files Modified**: `src/components/OrgMap.tsx`
**Commit**: `3328a32`

---

### Session 25 Details - OrgMap Infinite Loading Fix

**Problem**: Organization Map stuck on "Loading organization map..." in infinite loop

**Root Cause**: `fitView` from `useReactFlow()` was unstable across renders:

1. `fitView` recreated on each render
2. `loadData` useCallback depended on `fitView`
3. When `loadData` called `setNodes()`, component re-rendered
4. `fitView` changed → `loadData` recreated → useEffect triggered again
5. `setIsLoading(true)` reset before content could display

**Solution**: Used ref pattern to stabilize `fitView`:

- Created `fitViewRef` to store the function
- Replaced `fitView` with `fitViewRef.current` in callbacks
- Removed `fitView` from dependency arrays of `loadData` and `handleToggleLayout`

**Files Modified**: `src/components/OrgMap.tsx`
**Commit**: `78733fe`
