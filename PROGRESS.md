# OrgTree Progress Report

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE FOR ALL FUTURE CONVERSATIONS**:
> This file MUST be updated every time changes are made to the codebase. Add session details, features implemented, bugs fixed, and security improvements to the "Recent Activity" section. Update the "Last Updated" date. **CRITICAL: Always commit changes AND push to GitHub** - local commits are not enough! This ensures project history is maintained and future sessions have full context.

## 🎯 Key Preferences

**CRITICAL**: These preferences must be followed in every conversation to maintain consistency and avoid repetition.

### Update Workflow

- **PROGRESS.md updates are MANDATORY**: Update this file after EACH command/task completion (not just at end of session)
- **Commit AND push ALL changes**: Never leave commits local-only; always push to GitHub
- **Update "Last Updated" date**: Change to current date when making any updates
- **Document in "Recent Activity"**: Add session details, features, bugs fixed, decisions made

### Development Preferences

- **Render CLI**: Installed and configured with API key authentication (not using CLI tokens)
  - Used for manual deployment triggers and production troubleshooting
  - Can trigger deploys: `render deploy`
  - Can view logs: `render logs -s orgtree`
  - Can access shell: `render shell orgtree`

### Recent Activity

- **Last Major Update**: Critical Bug Fixes & Import Enhancements (January 10, 2026)
- **Total Commits**: 213+ commits on main branch (3 commits in Session 37)
- **Today's Progress (January 10, 2026 - Session 37)**:
  - 🚨 **CRITICAL FIX**: Resolved infinite loop causing Organization Map to not load
  - 🔧 **Root Cause**: Circular dependency in useCallback hooks
    - `loadData` depended on `handleToggleExpand`
    - `handleToggleExpand` depended on `edges`
    - `loadData` updated `edges` via `setEdges()`
    - This created an infinite re-render cycle
  - ✅ **Solution Implemented**:
    - Removed `handleToggleExpand` and `handleSelectPerson` from `loadData` dependencies
    - Removed callback injection from all layout functions (`handleToggleExpand`, `handleExpandAll`, `handleCollapseAll`, `handleToggleLayout`)
    - Callbacks now exclusively added via `nodesWithHighlight` useMemo (existing pattern)
    - Memoized real-time update callbacks to prevent unnecessary re-subscriptions
  - 🔧 **XML Import Name Format Fix**: Corrected name order in GEDS XML imports
    - **Issue**: Names were imported as "[Last Name], [First Name]" instead of "[First Name] [Last Name]"
    - **Root Cause**: Code was using the `fullName` field directly from XML (which is in "Last, First" format)
    - **Solution**: Always construct name from firstName + lastName fields in correct order
    - **Impact**: All imported names now display correctly as "First Last"
  - 🛡️ **Duplicate Department Prevention**: Backend now prevents duplicate departments
    - **Issue**: Importing same data twice created duplicate departments
    - **Root Cause**: Backend only checked for duplicate people, not departments
    - **Solution**: Added department duplicate check by name + parent_id combination
    - **Behavior**: If department exists, reuses existing ID instead of creating duplicate
    - **Metrics**: Tracks `departmentsCreated` vs `departmentsReused` separately
    - **Impact**: Safe to re-import data without creating duplicates
  - 📝 **Files Modified**:
    - `src/components/OrgMap.tsx` - Refactored callback dependency chain
    - `src/utils/xmlImport.ts` - Fixed name construction order
    - `server/src/routes/import.ts` - Added duplicate department detection
    - `src/types/index.ts` - Added departmentsReused field to CSVImportResult
    - `src/utils/csvImport.ts` - Added departmentsReused field to CSVImportResult
    - `src/components/admin/ImportModal.tsx` - Display departmentsReused in success message
  - ✅ **Testing**: All 275 tests pass (59 frontend + 216 backend)
  - 🎯 **Impact**: Organization Map loads + XML imports correct format + No duplicate departments

  **January 8, 2026 - CI Pipeline Unblocked (Session 25 Part 3)** 🚨🔧:
  - 🐛 **CRITICAL CI ISSUE**: GitHub Actions pipeline failing on formatting checks
  - 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**:
    - CI format:check step was failing on search.service.test.ts
    - Prettier found formatting inconsistencies in the test file
    - This was blocking all deployments to production
  - ✅ **FIX APPLIED**:
    - Ran `prettier --write` on search.service.test.ts
    - Fixed 62 lines of formatting inconsistencies
    - Verified formatting checks now pass
  - 📊 **TESTING**:
    - All 97 backend tests passing
    - All 32 frontend tests passing
    - Production build verified successful
    - Prettier format:check now passes
  - 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT**:
    - Pushed commit `f7d98c6` to main branch

  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED** (1 file):
    - `server/src/services/search.service.test.ts` (formatting fixed)

  **January 8, 2026 - Critical Bug Fix #2: Org Chart Lines Restored (Session 25 Part 2)** 🚨🔗:
  - 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG IDENTIFIED**: Department hierarchy lines not showing in Organization Map
  - 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**:
    - First fix (1732bec) corrected department.service.ts and people.service.ts
    - However, org.service.ts (used by OrgMap component) was missed
    - Frontend transformToFlowData() checks `dept.parent_id` to create edges
    - Backend org.service.ts still returned `dept.parentId` (camelCase)
    - When parent_id was undefined, no edges were created
    - Result: Departments rendered but no connecting lines displayed
  - ✅ **FIXES APPLIED**:
    - Fixed org.service.ts getOrganizationById() department query (3 fields: parent_id, organization_id, sort_order)
    - Fixed org.service.ts getOrganizationById() people query (3 fields: department_id, sort_order, created_at)
    - Fixed org.service.ts all organization queries (3 fields: created_by_id, created_at, updated_at)
    - Updated org.service.test.ts assertions (createdById → created_by_id)
  - 📊 **TESTING**:
    - All 97 backend tests passing
    - All 32 frontend tests passing
    - Production build verified successful
  - 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT**:
    - Pushed commit `da076d3` to main branch

    - `server/src/services/org.service.test.ts` (fixed 1 assertion)
  - 🎯 **PREVENTION**: Complete field naming consistency now achieved across ALL backend services

  **January 8, 2026 - Critical Bug Fix #1: Departments Now Visible (Session 25 Part 1)** 🚨🔧:
  - 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG IDENTIFIED**: Departments not visible in Departments tab
  - 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**:
    - TypeScript migration (Session 19) introduced field naming mismatch
    - Backend services returned camelCase fields (organizationId, parentId, sortOrder, etc.)
    - Frontend types expected snake_case fields (organization_id, parent_id, sort_order, etc.)
    - This caused silent data parsing failures - data was received but unrecognized
    - React rendered empty lists instead of crashing, hiding the bug
  - ✅ **FIXES APPLIED**:
    - Reverted `department.service.ts` to return snake_case from SQL queries
    - Reverted `people.service.ts` to return snake_case from SQL queries
    - Fixed `people.ts` route type assertion (departmentId → department_id)
    - Updated `department.service.test.ts` field name assertions
    - Updated `people.service.test.ts` field name assertions
  - 📊 **TESTING**:
    - All 97 backend tests passing (including updated test assertions)
    - All 32 frontend tests passing
    - Production build verified successful
  - 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT**:
    - Pushed commit `1732bec` to main branch
    - GitHub Actions CI/CD triggered
    - Deployed to production at <https://orgtree-app.onrender.com>
  - 💡 **IMPACT**:
    - Departments now display correctly in UI
    - Department creation/update/delete operations restored
    - People associations with departments working
    - Tree view, search, and bulk operations functioning
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED** (5 files):
    - `server/src/services/department.service.ts`
    - `server/src/services/people.service.ts`
    - `server/src/routes/people.ts`
    - `server/src/services/department.service.test.ts`
    - `server/src/services/people.service.test.ts`
  - 🎯 **LESSON LEARNED**: When migrating to TypeScript, maintain consistency between database schema (snake_case), backend responses, and frontend types to prevent silent parsing failures

  **January 7, 2026 - Code Cleanup, Testing & Compliance (Session 22)** 🧹🧪⚖️:

    - **Commits**: 3 commits (main migration + 2 fixes)
    - **Time**: ~4 hours (estimated based on agent work)
  - 🎯 **KEY TECHNICAL PATTERNS ESTABLISHED**:
    - **Backend**: All imports use `.js` extensions for ES modules
    - **Express**: Route handlers return `Promise<void>`, not data types
    - **Database**: Query results typed with `as Type | undefined` assertions
    - **SQLite**: Boolean conversion with `Boolean(value)` for 0/1 values
    - **Socket.IO**: Event handlers use `(...args: unknown[])` with type assertions
    - **React**: All components have explicit prop interfaces

  - 🚀 **DEPLOYED**: All commits pushed to GitHub, production build successful
  - 🎉 **STATUS**: TypeScript migration 100% complete with enterprise-grade type safety

  **January 7, 2026 - CI Pipeline Fixes (Session 20)** ✅:
  - ✅ **CI PIPELINE NOW PASSING**: All GitHub Actions checks green
  - ✅ **RENDER DEPLOYMENT FIX**:
    - **Issue**: `tsx: not found` error in production
    - **Root Cause**: `tsx` was in devDependencies, but Render runs `npm install --production`
    - **Fix**: Moved `tsx` to dependencies in server/package.json
    - **Result**: Production deployment successful, server running
  - ✅ **BACKEND ESLINT FIXES** (74 errors → 0):
    - **@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any**: Replaced all `any` types with proper TypeScript types
    - **Routes**: Changed `error: any` to `error: unknown` with type guards
    - **Services**: Created proper interfaces (DeletedPerson, MovedPerson, BulkEditFields, etc.)
    - **Socket Events**: Changed `Record<string, any>` to `Record<string, unknown>`
    - **Test Files**: Converted `require()` to `await import()` for ES modules
    - **Global Types**: Added eslint-disable for empty interface (required for Express augmentation)
  - ✅ **PRETTIER FORMATTING** (30 files formatted):
    - Applied consistent code style across all backend TypeScript files
    - Fixed inconsistent indentation, line breaks, and quote styles
    - Ensured CI format check passes
  - ✅ **KEY INSIGHT: Pre-commit vs CI**:
    - Pre-commit hooks use `lint-staged` (only checks staged files)
    - CI pipeline lints the entire codebase
    - Files modified before staging weren't checked by pre-commit but caught by CI
  - 📁 **FILES MODIFIED**:
    - server/package.json (tsx moved to dependencies)
    - 30 backend TypeScript files (Prettier formatting)
    - 15+ route files (any → unknown type fixes)
    - 10+ service files (proper interfaces)
    - 3 test files (require → import)
  - 🎯 **FINAL CI STATUS**: All checks passing ✅
    - ESLint: 0 errors
    - Prettier: All files formatted
    - Tests: 76 passing (44 backend + 32 frontend)
    - Build: Successful
    - Type-check: 0 errors

  - Emails from `onboarding@resend.dev` may go to spam (custom domain recommended for production)
- **KNOWN LIMITATIONS**:
  - Sandbox mode: Resend only delivers to verified email addresses unless custom domain is configured
  - Invitation expiry: 7 days (hardcoded)
  - One pending invitation per email per organization (prevents duplicates)
- **CRITICAL BUG FIX - Invitation Acceptance**:
  - ✅ **BUG FIXED**: Invitation acceptance now properly creates members and updates status
  - ✅ **ROOT CAUSE**: Missing `await` keyword in route handler caused response before DB operations completed
  - ✅ **SYMPTOMS**: Invitations showed as "pending" after acceptance, users had no access to organization
  - ✅ **SOLUTION**:
    - Added `await` to `acceptInvitation` call in route handler
    - Added validation to verify member insertion succeeds (checks `changes > 0`)
    - Added validation to verify invitation status update succeeds (checks `changes > 0`)
    - Throws errors if database operations fail
  - ✅ **FILES MODIFIED**:
    - `server/src/routes/invitations.js`: Added await keyword
    - `server/src/services/invitation.service.js`: Added database operation validation
  - 📝 **IMPACT**: Invitation acceptance now properly adds users as members and marks invitations as accepted

**December 24, 2025 - Infinite Password Change Loop Fix** 🔐:

- ✅ **CRITICAL BUG FIXED**: Users no longer stuck in infinite password change redirect loop
- ✅ **ROOT CAUSE**: `getUserById` function didn't return `must_change_password` field
- ✅ **SYMPTOMS**: After changing temporary password and logging back in, users redirected to change password page infinitely
- ✅ **TECHNICAL ISSUE**:
  - User object missing `mustChangePassword` field after login
  - ProtectedRoute couldn't determine if password was actually changed
  - Field was being cleared in DB but not returned in API responses
- ✅ **SOLUTION**:
  - Added `must_change_password` to `getUserById` SELECT query
  - Converted `getUserById` to return camelCase fields (`mustChangePassword`)
  - Added validation for password UPDATE query (verifies `changes > 0`)
  - Returns error if password update fails
- ✅ **FILES MODIFIED**:
  - `server/src/services/auth.service.js`: Updated getUserById to include and format must_change_password
  - `server/src/routes/auth.js`: Added validation for password update operation
- 📝 **IMPACT**: Temporary password flow now works correctly - users can change password and access the app

**December 23, 2025 - User Search Bug Fix** 🐛:

- ✅ **BUG FIXED**: User search in collaboration feature now works correctly

- ✅ **SOLUTION**: Renamed route from `/users/search` to `/members/search`
- ✅ **FILES MODIFIED**:
  - `server/src/routes/members.js`: Changed route path
  - `src/api/client.js`: Updated API endpoint URL
  - `src/components/admin/UserSearchSelect.jsx`: Cleaned up debug logs
- ✅ **DEBUG CLEANUP**: Removed console.log statements from previous debugging session
- 📝 **IMPACT**: Non-superuser admins can now search and add members to organizations

**December 22, 2025 - Debugging User Search Feature** 🔍:

- ✅ **TESTING SUPPORT**: Created test users (Alice, Bob, Carol) in local database
- ✅ **FILES MODIFIED**:
  - server/src/routes/members.js
  - src/api/client.js
  - src/components/admin/UserSearchSelect.jsx
  - src/components/admin/AddMemberModal.jsx
  - src/components/admin/ShareModal.jsx
- 📝 **NEXT STEPS**: User to test with browser console open (F12) to diagnose issue

- 📝 **IMPACT**: Improves navigation and makes user role immediately visible across all pages

**December 22, 2025 - Rate Limiter Configuration Fix**:

- ✅ **CRITICAL PRODUCTION FIX**: Removed unsupported `trustProxy` option from rate limiters
- ✅ **ROOT CAUSE**: express-rate-limit version doesn't support `trustProxy` configuration option
- ✅ **ERROR**: ValidationError: Unexpected configuration option: trustProxy (ERR_ERL_UNKNOWN_OPTION)
- ✅ **SOLUTION**: Removed `trustProxy: true` from both authLimiter and passwordResetLimiter
- ✅ **EXPLANATION**: `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` in main server file handles proxy trust globally
- ✅ **FILES MODIFIED**:
  - server/src/routes/auth.js (removed line 17)
  - server/src/routes/users.js (removed line 23)
- ✅ **IMPACT**: Fixes server startup crash in production on Render
- 📝 **NOTE**: This was incorrectly added in commit 00da4a9 based on misunderstanding of rate limiter library

**December 22, 2025 - Create User + Force Password Change Feature**:

- **MAJOR FEATURE**: Superusers can create new users with auto-generated temporary passwords
- **MAJOR FEATURE**: Users must change password on first login after creation or password reset
- **Backend Changes**:
  - Added `must_change_password` column migration to users table
  - Created `createAdminUser` function generating cryptographic 12-char temporary passwords
  - Updated `resetUserPassword` to set `must_change_password` flag to true
  - Updated `loginUser` to return `mustChangePassword` field in user object
  - Added POST `/api/users` endpoint for creating users (superuser only)
  - Added POST `/api/auth/change-password` endpoint for password changes (authenticated)
- **Frontend Changes**:
  - Created CreateUserModal component with two-step flow (form → success with temp password display)
  - Created ChangePasswordPage component for forced password changes
  - Updated UserManagement with "Create User" button and modal integration
  - Updated ProtectedRoute to redirect to `/change-password` if `mustChangePassword` is true
  - Added `/change-password` route to App.jsx
  - Added `createUser` and `changePassword` API methods to client.js
- **User Flow**:
  1. Superuser creates new user via Create User button
  2. System generates 12-char cryptographic temporary password
  3. Temporary password shown once with copy-to-clipboard functionality
  4. New user logs in with temporary password
  5. User immediately redirected to `/change-password` (cannot access app)
  6. After changing password, user logged out and must log in again with new password
  7. `must_change_password` flag cleared, user gains full app access
- **Security Features**:
  - Temporary passwords are cryptographically random (12 alphanumeric characters)
  - Password change requires authentication (can't bypass)
  - Users locked out of app until password changed
  - Password reset also triggers forced password change
  - Minimum password length: 6 characters
  - Passwords hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds)

  - Created `users.service.js` with full CRUD operations for user management
  - Created `users.js` routes with 6 superuser-only endpoints (list, get, update, change role, reset password, delete)
  - Updated default role from 'admin' to 'user' for new signups
  - Added rate limiting for password reset endpoint
  - **PRODUCTION FIX**: Added `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` and `trustProxy: true` to rate limiters to fix rate limiting behind Render's proxy
- **Frontend Changes**:
  - Added role helpers to AuthContext (`isSuperuser`, `isAdmin`, `canManageUsers`)
  - Updated ProtectedRoute with `requiredRole` prop and role hierarchy checking
  - Created `/admin` route with SuperuserLayout for system administration
  - Created UserManagement page with search, filter, and CRUD operations
  - Created UserForm modal for editing user details and roles

  - Added "System Admin" link in AdminLayout for superusers
- **Security Features**:
  - Cannot change own role (prevents lock-out)
  - Cannot delete own account
  - Cryptographically secure temporary password generation
  - All role checks enforced server-side
  - Rate limiting on password reset
- **Files Modified**: 9 files (added trust proxy fix)
- **Files Created**: 5 new files
- **Database Path in Production**: `/opt/render/project/src/data/production.db`

**December 22, 2025 - Mobile Scrolling Fix**:

- ✅ **CRITICAL UX FIX**: Fixed mobile scrolling in department node people lists
- ✅ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: React Flow's panOnDrag was intercepting touch events on iPhone Safari
- ✅ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: Added CSS touch-action: pan-y property to scrollable containers
- ✅ **FILES MODIFIED**:
  - Added `.touch-pan-y` utility class to src/index.css
  - Applied class to people list container in src/components/DepartmentNode.jsx
- ✅ **TESTING APPROACH**: Deployed directly to production (low-risk CSS-only change)
- ✅ **IMPACT**: Users can now scroll people lists on mobile without triggering canvas pan
- ✅ **PRESERVED FUNCTIONALITY**: Canvas panning, pinch-to-zoom, and all touch gestures still work
