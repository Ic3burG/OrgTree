# ADR-014: Test Coverage Expansion

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-01-25
**Deciders**: Development Team
**Tags**: testing, quality, ci-cd
**Target**: 80%+ Code Coverage across Backend and Frontend

## Overview

While the project has made significant strides in test coverage (increasing from ~210 to ~902 tests), specific areas remain under-tested. This plan outlines a systematic approach to reaching >80% code coverage by targeting critical gaps in backend services, frontend complex logic, and edge cases.

## Current Status Analysis

### Backend (Node.js/Express)

- **Strengths**:
  - Route handlers (~93% coverage)
  - Core CRUD operations
  - Authentication flows (including 2FA/Passkeys)
  - Search system (FTS5)
  - Authorization middleware
  - Backup & Migration logic (New)
  - **Performance & Edge Cases** (New)
- **Weaknesses/Gaps**:
  - Service-layer error handling: Many "happy paths" are tested, but specific database error scenarios (constraints, connection timeouts) need consistent coverage.
  - Edge cases in complex logic (e.g., circular hierarchy detection, large bulk operations).

### Frontend (React/Vite)

- **Strengths**:
  - Utility functions (`xmlImport`, `csvImport`)
  - Basic component rendering
  - Search overlay logic
  - **Auth Context**
  - **Socket Context**
  - **Form Validation**
  - **OrgMap & Toolbar** (New)
  - **Data Import UI** (New)
- **Weaknesses/Gaps**:
  - **Custom Hooks**: Complex state management hooks (besides RealtimeUpdates).
  - **Integration**: End-to-end flows for complex multi-step processes.

## Execution Phases

### Phase 1: Critical Backend Service Gaps (✅ Completed)

Target the known "zero coverage" or "low coverage" files to ensure safety for infrastructure tasks.

1. **Backup Service (`server/src/services/backup.service.ts`)** ✅
   - Test backup creation (file system interaction).
   - Test backup restoration (database locking/swapping).
   - Test retention policy (cleanup of old backups).
   - _Mocking Strategy_: Mock `fs` and `better-sqlite3` backup API.

2. **Database & Migration Utilities (`server/src/db.ts`)** ✅
   - Test migration execution logic.
   - Test schema validation helpers.
   - _Note_: Refactored into `db-init.ts` for testability.

3. **Analytics Service (`server/src/services/analytics.service.ts`)**
   - Ensure data retention policies are tested.
   - Test aggregation queries for dashboards.

### Phase 2: Frontend Core Logic (Hooks & Contexts) (✅ Completed)

Move beyond simple component rendering tests to testing the "brain" of the frontend.

1. **Auth Context (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)** ✅
   - Test session persistence/hydration.
   - Test auto-logout on 401.
   - Test permission helper functions (`canManage`, `isOwner`).

2. **Socket Integration (`src/contexts/SocketContext.tsx`)** ✅
   - Test event subscription/unsubscription.
   - Test state updates on incoming events.
   - Test connection/disconnection logic.

3. **Form Logic & Validation** ✅
   - **Person Form**: Test validation (email, required fields) and custom field integration.
   - **Department Form**: Test circular reference prevention logic and hierarchy filtering.

### Phase 3: Complex Interactive Components (✅ Completed)

1. **Organization Map Logic (`src/components/OrgMap.tsx` & helpers)** ✅
   - Test layout calculation (Dagre integration) in isolation.
   - Test search result highlighting logic.
   - Test toolbar actions (Expand/Collapse/Layout).

2. **Search & Navigation UI** ✅
   - **Search Overlay**: Test result display and type filtering.
   - **Hierarchical Selector**: Test keyboard navigation and node expansion.

3. **Data Import UI (`src/components/admin/ImportModal.tsx`)** ✅
   - Test file selection and parsing state transitions.
   - Test error display for malformed files.
   - Test duplicate warning presentations.

### Phase 4: Integration & Edge Cases (✅ Completed)

1. **Cascade Delete Scenarios** ✅
   - Verify (via integration test) that deleting a department soft-deletes all descendants and unassigns/soft-deletes people.

2. **Concurrency** ✅
   - Simulate concurrent edits to the same organization in backend tests to verify optimistic locking or last-write-wins behavior (ensure no crashes).

3. **Large Dataset Performance** ✅
   - Add regression tests for performance-critical endpoints (e.g., `GET /org-map`) to ensure response times remain within limits for known dataset sizes.

### Phase 5: Maintenance & Frontend Quality (💡 Proposed)

With the backend reaching its >80% target, focus shifts to sustaining those gains and bringing the frontend to parity.

1. **Coverage Maintenance & Ratcheting**
   - Implement a automated ratchet mechanism to prevent coverage degradation.
   - Enforce strict thresholds in CI/CD.
   - See [RFC: Automated Coverage Maintenance & Ratcheting](../rfc/coverage-maintenance-ratcheting.md).

2. **Frontend Quality & E2E Expansion**
   - Target 60% frontend statement coverage.
   - Expand Playwright suite to cover all Critical User Journeys (CUJs).
   - Introduce Visual Regression Testing (VRT).
   - See [RFC: Frontend Quality & E2E Testing Strategy](../rfc/frontend-quality-e2e-strategy.md).

## Success Metrics

- **Backend Statement Coverage**: > 80% (✅ **Completed**: 80.82% on Jan 28, 2026)
- **Frontend Statement Coverage**: > 60% (⏳ **In Progress**: 36%)
- **Critical Paths**: 100% coverage on Auth, Permissions, and Data Import/Export logic.
- **CI Execution Time**: Maintain < 5 minutes total (use parallelization if needed).

## Tools & Configuration

- **Backend**: Vitest, Supertest
- **Frontend**: Vitest, React Testing Library, User Event
- **Reporting**: use `npm run coverage` to generate lcov reports.

## Implementation Notes

- **Do not over-mock**: For backend tests, prefer using the in-memory SQLite database over mocking the DB layer to catch SQL errors.
- **Component Tests**: Focus on user interaction (clicks, typing) rather than internal state assertions.
- **Snapshot Testing**: Use sparingly for complex UI structures (like the OrgMap SVG output) to catch regressions in rendering.
