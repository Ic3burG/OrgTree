## Dark Mode

### Enabling Dark Mode

Dark mode can be toggled from multiple locations throughout the application:

**From Login/Signup Pages:**

1. Look for the **moon icon** (🌙) in the top-right corner
2. Click to toggle between light and dark modes

3. Toggle between light and dark modes

### Dark Mode Features

| Feature                         | Description                                              |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Persistent Preference**       | Your dark mode choice is saved in your browser           |
| **System Preference Detection** | On first visit, respects your system's dark mode setting |
| **Instant Switching**           | Changes apply immediately without page refresh           |
| **Consistent Colors**           | All components follow the same dark mode color scheme    |
| **Accessible**                  | Maintains WCAG AA contrast ratios in both modes          |

### Where Dark Mode Works

Dark mode is available throughout the entire application:

✅ **Authentication Pages**

- Login page
- Signup page
- Password change page

✅ **Main Layouts**

- Admin dashboard and sidebar
- Superuser dashboard and sidebar
- Organization selector page

✅ **Visualization**

- Department manager
- People manager
- Audit log
- Bulk operation modals

✅ **Utility Components**

- Error pages
- Loading states
- Modals and dialogs
- Forms and inputs

### Dark Mode Color Scheme

The dark mode uses a carefully selected color palette:

| Element             | Light Mode    | Dark Mode     |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Background**      | White/Gray-50 | Slate-800/900 |
| **Text**            | Gray-900      | Slate-100     |
| **Borders**         | Gray-200      | Slate-700     |
| **Hover States**    | Gray-50       | Slate-700     |
| **Active Elements** | Blue-50       | Blue-900/30   |

### Troubleshooting Dark Mode

**Dark mode not persisting after refresh:**

- Check that your browser allows localStorage
- Try clearing browser cache and toggling again

**Some elements not switching:**

- Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Ensure you're using a supported browser

**Preference not syncing across devices:**

- Dark mode preference is stored locally per browser
- You'll need to enable it on each device/browser

### Technical Details

For developers and advanced users:

- **Storage Key**: `orgTreeDarkMode` in localStorage
- **Values**: `"true"` (dark) or `"false"` (light)
- **System Detection**: Uses `prefers-color-scheme` media query
- **Implementation**: Tailwind CSS class-based dark mode

#### Registering a Passkey

1. Go to **Settings** → **Security**
2. In the **Passkeys** section, click **"Add Passkey"**
3. Follow your browser/device prompts:
   - On iPhone/Mac: Use Face ID or Touch ID
   - On Windows: Use Windows Hello
   - On Android: Use fingerprint or face unlock

   - 1Password
   - Microsoft Authenticator
4. Enter the 6-digit code from your app to verify
5. **Save your backup codes** in a secure location

> **Important**: Backup codes are shown only once. Store them safely - they're your only recovery option if you lose your authenticator device.

#### Using 2FA

When 2FA is enabled:

1. Log in with email and password (or passkey)
2. Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app
3. Optionally check "Remember this device" for trusted devices

#### Backup Codes

- 8 single-use backup codes are generated when you enable 2FA
- Each code can only be used once
- Use a backup code if you can't access your authenticator
- Regenerate codes if you run low or suspect compromise

#### Disabling 2FA

1. Go to **Settings** → **Security**
2. Click **"Disable 2FA"**
